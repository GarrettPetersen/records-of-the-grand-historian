Initially, Shangguan Jie and his son An contended for power with Grand General Huo Guang and wished to harm him. They falsely had someone submit a memorial to King Dan of Yan accusing Guang of crimes. At that time the emperor was fourteen years old and perceived their deception. Later, when there were those who slandered Guang, the emperor would always angrily say: 'The Grand General is a loyal minister of the state, entrusted by the late emperor. Anyone who dares to slander or defame him shall be punished.' Because of this, Guang was able to serve with complete loyalty. The story is told in the Biographies of King Yan and Huo Guang.",
