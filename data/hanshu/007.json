Virtue extended even to birds and beasts, and teachings reached the four seas. Overseas peoples were submissive and obedient. To the north they attacked Qusou, and the Di and Qiang came and submitted. The stars did not show comets, the sun and moon did not eclipse, mountains did not collapse, rivers and valleys were not blocked; Unicorns and phoenixes appeared in suburban marshes, and the Yellow and Luo rivers produced diagrams and writings. Alas! What policies brought about such results? Now I have the honor of serving the ancestral temples. I rise early to seek solutions and lie awake at night thinking about them, like crossing deep waters with no knowledge of reaching the shore. How magnificent! How splendid! What course of action can manifest the great enterprises and splendid virtues of the former emperors, equaling Yao and Shun above, and matching the Three Kings below?

          "literal": "In the eleventh month of winter of the first year of Yuanshuo, he issued this edict: 'Dukes, ministers, and grandees are those who unify strategies, unite categories, broaden education, and beautify customs. Indeed, rooting in benevolence and ancestor righteousness, praising virtue and stipending the worthy, encouraging good and punishing violence—these are what made the Five Emperors and Three Kings prosper. I rise early and sleep late at night, rejoicing that scholars throughout the world reach this road. Therefore gather the elders, exempt the filial and respectful, select the outstanding and talented, discuss literature and learning, examine and participate in government affairs, seek to advance the people's hearts, deeply command officials, promote integrity and recommend the filial, perhaps establish this as fashion, and continue the splendid legacy of the sages. Indeed, in a settlement of ten households, there will certainly be the loyal and trustworthy; When three people walk together, among them is my teacher. Now some reach an entire commandery yet do not recommend even one person. This means transformation does not reach the bottom, and gentlemen of accumulated virtue are blocked from being heard above. Two thousand shi officials who lead and regulate human relationships—how can they assist me in illuminating the hidden and obscure, encouraging the primary people, encouraging the steaming masses, and honoring the teachings of villages and communities? Moreover, advancing the worthy receives the highest reward, concealing the worthy suffers clear execution. This is the ancient way. Discuss with the middle two thousand shi, ritual officials, and doctors the crime of those who do not recommend.' The relevant officials memorialized in discussion: 'In ancient times, feudal lords contributed scholars. One time was called loving virtue, two times worthy of the worthy, three times having merit, then the nine bestowments were added; Not contributing scholars: once then demote rank, twice then demote land, three times and rank and land are completely demoted. Indeed, attaching to below and deceiving above means death; attaching to above and deceiving below means punishment; participating in hearing state government yet providing no benefit to the people means rejection; being in upper position yet unable to advance the worthy means retreat. This is what encourages good and expels evil. Now the edict writings illuminate the former emperor's sage legacy, ordering two thousand shi to recommend the filial and incorrupt. This transforms the primary people and shifts winds and changes customs. Not recommending the filial, not obeying the edict, should be judged as disrespect. Not examining the incorrupt means not able to bear responsibility, should be dismissed.' The memorial was approved.",
