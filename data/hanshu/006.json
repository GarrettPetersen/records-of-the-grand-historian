The establishment of ritual and music each had their origins.' Singers express virtue; dancers clarify merit.' At the Gao Temple autumn sacrifice, perform the Martial Virtue, Literary Beginning, and Five Phases dances. At the Xiaohui Temple autumn sacrifice, perform the Literary Beginning and Five Phases dances. In spring, first month, an edict declared: 'Agriculture is the foundation of the realm. No duty is greater.' Order the commanderies and kingdoms to diligently encourage farming and sericulture, increase planting of trees, so that clothing and food may be obtained.' Order the regional kings, marquises, and officials of 2000 shi to share in labor with the people.' In summer, fourth month, yi-mao day, he granted amnesty to the realm. On ding-you day, he granted amnesty to the realm. In the fifth month, an edict declared: 'Commend filial piety, fraternal duty, and working the fields. Call them \"Three Elders,\" \"Filial and Fraternal,\" \"Working the Fields.\" Each receives five bolts of silk.' Order the imperial secretaries: 'Inspect and recommend from the Three Adjuncts, Three Rivers, and Hongnong two each of \"Three Elders,\" \"Filial and Fraternal,\" \"Working the Fields.\" Order the Chancellor and Imperial Secretaries to examine them according to the laws and ordinances.' In the sixth month, an edict declared: 'The carriages, riders, and horses are not complete. Order the realm to provide one horse and one chariot team.' In autumn, seventh month, an edict declared: 'If officials receive their subordinates but do not restrain them with law, then they become negligent and corrupt officials accomplish their private interests.' They receive punishment for perverting the law, or escape through affairs, or flee through wealth.' Now I continue to receive the imperial seal and ascend the throne. I follow the former kings' regulations, examine ancient and modern practices, change the laws, ease punishments, eliminate burdensome taxes, lighten corvee labor, eliminate hateful and evil things, and promote the filial and worthy.' I wish to make the people peaceful, officials not corrupt, superiors and inferiors harmonious, ghosts and spirits joyful, and prevent disasters and calamities from arising.' However, the people are not yet transformed, officials are not yet enlightened, prisons are not yet empty, lawsuits are not yet few, corvee is not yet light, taxes are not yet few, officials are not yet sufficient, people are not yet rich.' This is because my virtue is not yet bright, my teaching has not yet reached them, my governance is not yet perfected.' I am frightened and fearful, not knowing where to begin.' I have heard that in ancient times, the people were few and affairs were simple. Superiors were easy to serve, subordinates were easy to govern. Materials were sufficient for use, people were sufficient for labor.' Therefore the people were happy in their places, joyful in their occupations. The old and young had their proper places, men and women had their proper ways.' Evil and wickedness did not arise, litigation did not occur. The strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not bully the few. The orphaned and widowed were cared for, the poor and destitute were supported.' This was the beauty of the utmost governance.'",
