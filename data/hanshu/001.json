He instructed the other officials: 'Anyone whose gift is less than a thousand cash must sit below the main hall.' Gaozu was the local sheriff and usually treated officials casually. He tricked them by announcing 'Ten thousand cash congratulations gift' but actually brought nothing. When the announcement came in, Lü Gong was astonished. He rose and went to welcome Gaozu at the gate. Lü Gong loved reading faces. When he saw Gaozu's features, he was greatly impressed and seated him in the place of honor. Xiao He said, 'Liu Ji talks big but accomplishes little.' Because he treated all the guests with casual familiarity and mockery, Gaozu ended up taking the seat of honor without yielding to anyone. As the banquet wound down, Lü Gong exchanged glances and insisted on keeping Gaozu behind. They finished drinking, and afterward... Lü Gong said, 'Since I was young, I've loved reading faces.
