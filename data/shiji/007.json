Liang said: 'Huan Chu has fled. No one knows his place. Only Ji knows it.' Liang then went out and warned Ji to hold his sword and wait outside. Liang again entered and sat with the governor, saying: 'Please summon Ji to make him receive the command to summon Huan Chu.' The governor said: 'Agreed.' Liang summoned Ji to enter. In a moment, Liang winked at Ji, saying: 'Can act already!' Thereupon Ji drew his sword and beheaded the governor. Xiang Liang held the governor's head and wore his seal ribbons. Those below the gate were greatly startled and disturbed. Ji struck and killed several tens of people. Everyone in the office was terrified and submitted. None dared rise. Liang then summoned the heroic officials he formerly knew, explained what they were doing to raise great matters, and raised the Wuzhong troops. He had people collect from the lower counties and obtained eight thousand elite troops. Liang deployed the heroic outstanding men of Wuzhong as company commanders, scouts, and adjutants. There was one person who did not obtain use. He spoke to Liang himself. Liang said: 'In former times, a certain mourning made you duke handle certain matters. You could not manage them. With this I did not employ you.' The crowd then all submitted. Thereupon Liang became the Kuiji governor, Ji became assistant general, and toured the lower counties.",

Xiang Liang then with eight thousand people crossed the Jiang westward. He heard Chen Ying had already submitted Dongyang. He sent an envoy wishing to connect in harmony and go west together. Chen Ying was a former Dongyang magistrate's secretary. He resided in the county, was originally trustworthy and careful, called an elder. The Dongyang youths killed their magistrate, mutually gathered several thousand people. They wished to establish a leader. None was suitable. They then requested Chen Ying. Ying declined he could not. They then strongly established Ying as leader. The county followers obtained twenty thousand people. The youths wished to establish Ying directly as king, with different army dark heads specially rising. Chen Ying's mother said to Ying: 'Since I became your family's woman, I have never heard that your ancestors had noble ones. Now you have suddenly obtained a great name. This is not auspicious. It is not as good as having a belonging. If matters succeed, you can still obtain enfeoffment as marquis. If matters fail, it is easy to flee. You will not be what the world points to by name.' Ying then did not dare to be king. He said to his army officials: 'The Xiang clan is generation after generation a general's family, has name in Chu. Now we wish to raise great matters. If the general is not the right person, it is not possible. I rely on the famous clan. Perishing Qin is certain.' Thereupon the crowd followed his words and attached their troops to Xiang Liang.

          "literal": "Initially, the Qi envoy Lord Gaoling Xian whom Song Yi had encountered was in the Chu army. He saw the Chu king and said: 'Song Yi predicted that Lord Wuxin's army would certainly be defeated. Several days later, the army was indeed defeated. He foresaw the signs of defeat before the troops even fought. This can be called true knowledge of warfare.' The king summoned Song Yi to discuss matters and was greatly pleased with him. Therefore he appointed him as supreme general, Xiang Yu as Duke of Lu and deputy general, Fan Zeng as rear general, to rescue Zhao. All the other generals were subordinated to Song Yi, who was titled Champion Marquis. They marched to Anyang but stayed there forty-six days without advancing. Xiang Yu said: 'I hear that Qin's army is surrounding King Zhao at Julu. We should quickly lead our troops across the river. Chu will strike from the outside, Zhao will respond from the inside. Breaking Qin's army is certain.' Song Yi said: 'Not so. One cannot defeat lice and ticks by fighting horseflies on an ox. Now Qin is attacking Zhao. If they win, their troops will be weary. We can inherit their exhaustion; If they don't win, then we lead our troops beating drums westward and will certainly take Qin. Therefore it is better to first let Qin and Zhao fight each other. When it comes to wearing armor and wielding sharp weapons, I am not as good as you; But when it comes to sitting and directing strategy, you are not as good as I.' Therefore he issued an order in the army saying: 'Those fierce as tigers, stubborn as sheep, greedy as wolves, who are strong but cannot be used—all shall be beheaded.' He then sent his son Song Xiang as prime minister of Qi. He personally escorted him to Wuyan and held grand drinking parties. The weather was bitterly cold with heavy rain. The soldiers were freezing and starving. Xiang Yu said: 'We are supposed to unite our strength to attack Qin, but we stay here for a long time without moving. This year brings famine and poverty to the people. Our soldiers eat only taros and beans. The army has no visible stores of grain. Yet he drinks wine and holds grand gatherings. He doesn't lead troops across the river to rely on Zhao's food supplies and combine forces with Zhao to attack Qin. Instead he says 'inherit their fatigue'. Given Qin's strength attacking the newly established Zhao, their momentum will certainly take Zhao. If Zhao falls and Qin remains strong, what fatigue will there be to inherit! Moreover, our state's troops have been newly broken. The king cannot sit at ease. He has swept the entire realm and placed it exclusively under the general. The state's safety or danger rests on this one action. Now he does not pity the soldiers but follows his private interests. He is not a minister of the state altars.' Xiang Yu went to the morning audience with Supreme General Song Yi, and immediately in his tent beheaded Song Yi. He issued an order in the army saying: 'Song Yi conspired with Qi to rebel against Chu. The Chu king secretly ordered me to execute him.' At this time, all the generals trembled and submitted. None dared to oppose. They all said: 'The ones who first established Chu were the general's family. Now the general has executed the rebel.' They then mutually agreed to establish Yu as acting supreme general. They sent people to pursue Song Yi's son. They caught up with him in Qi and killed him. They sent Huan Chu to report the command to King Huai. King Huai therefore made Xiang Yu supreme general. Lord Dangyang and General Pu all came under Xiang Yu.",

The Second Generation Emperor sent people to blame Zhang Han. Zhang Han grew fearful. He sent his chief clerk Xin to negotiate surrender. He arrived at Xianyang and waited at the Sima Gate for three days. Zhao Gao did not see him. He had thoughts of distrust. Chief Clerk Xin grew fearful. He returned and fled to his army. He did not dare take the old road. Zhao Gao indeed sent people to pursue him, but they did not catch up. Xin arrived at the army and reported: 'Zhao Gao handles affairs in the court. There is nothing that can be done below. If we win battles now, Gao will quickly envy my merit; If we cannot win battles, we cannot avoid death. I hope the general will carefully consider this.' Chen Yu also sent Zhang Han a letter saying: 'Bai Qi was a Qin general. He conquered Yan and Ying in the south, buried Ma Fu's army in the north, attacked cities and seized lands beyond counting, yet was finally granted death. Meng Tian was a Qin general. He pursued the Rong people north, opened up several thousand li of Yuzhong land, yet was finally beheaded at Yangzhou. Why? Their merits were too many. Qin could not fully reward them, so they executed them by law. The general has been a Qin general for three years. His losses number in the hundreds of thousands. Meanwhile the feudal lords have risen together and grown even more numerous. That Zhao Gao has long been flattering. Now matters are urgent. He also fears the Second Generation will execute him. Therefore he wants to execute the general by law to shift responsibility, and send someone to replace the general to escape his own calamity. The general has been stationed outside for a long time. There have been many retreats within. Whether you have merit or not, you will be executed. Moreover, that Heaven has abandoned Qin—both foolish and wise all know this. Now the general cannot remonstrate directly within, and outside he is the general of a perished state. He stands isolated and alone yet wishes to survive forever. How sorrowful! Why doesn't the general turn his troops and ally with the feudal lords? Agree to attack Qin together, divide and rule its lands, face south and call himself sovereign; How does this compare to prostrating your body on the executioner's block, with your wife and children slaughtered?' Zhang Han hesitated. He secretly sent the scout Shi Cheng as envoy to Xiang Yu, wishing to make an agreement. The agreement was not yet completed. Xiang Yu had General Pu lead troops day and night across Sanhu. The army was south of the Zhang River. They fought with Qin and again defeated them. Xiang Yu led all his troops to strike the Qin army on the Wushui River and greatly defeated them.",

He said: 'Do not follow him and die together.' Zhang Liang said: 'I escorted Liu Bang for the King of Han. Liu Bang's matters are now urgent. To flee would not be righteous. I cannot fail to tell him.' Liang then entered and fully told Liu Bang. Liu Bang was greatly startled and said: 'What should I do?' Zhang Liang said: 'Who devised this plan for the great king?' He said: 'A small man advised me, saying \"Bar the pass, do not admit the feudal lords. You can rule all Qin lands.\" So I listened to him.' Liang said: 'Do you estimate that the great king's soldiers are sufficient to match King Xiang?' Liu Bang was silent, then said: 'Certainly not equal. Moreover, what should I do?' Zhang Liang said: 'Please go tell Xiang Bo that Liu Bang dares not turn against King Xiang.' Liu Bang said: 'Sir, how do you have an old friendship with Xiang Bo?' Zhang Liang said: 'During Qin times, Xiang Bo wandered with me. Xiang Bo killed a man, and I saved him. Now matters are urgent, so fortunately he came to tell me.' Liu Bang said: 'Who is younger or older than you?' Liang said: 'Older than me.' Liu Bang said: 'Sir, call him in for me. I will treat him as an elder brother.' Zhang Liang went out and intercepted Xiang Bo. Xiang Bo immediately entered and saw Liu Bang.

          "literal": "The next day Liu Bang came to see King Xiang with more than a hundred riders. He arrived at Hongmen and apologized, saying: 'Your minister united with the general to attack Qin. The general fought north of the river, your minister fought south of the river. Yet I did not expect to be able to enter the passes first and break Qin, and thus meet the general again here. Now there are the words of petty men, causing a rift between the general and your minister.' King Xiang said: 'This was spoken by Liu Bang's left adjutant Cao Wushang; Otherwise, why would I, Ji, have come to this point.' King Xiang therefore kept Liu Bang that day and drank with him. King Xiang and Xiang Bo sat facing east. Yafu sat facing south. Yafu was Fan Zeng. Liu Bang sat facing north. Zhang Liang served facing west. Fan Zeng frequently glanced at King Xiang. He raised his jade tablet three times to signal him. King Xiang remained silent and did not respond. Fan Zeng rose and went out to summon Xiang Zhuang. He said: 'Our lord king is not a cruel person. If you enter and make a toast first, and when the toast is finished, request to dance with swords, then take advantage to strike Liu Bang at his seat and kill him. If not, you and all your kind will moreover be captured by him.' Zhuang then entered and made a toast. When the toast was finished, he said: 'The lord king is drinking with Liu Bang. The army has nothing for merriment. Please allow me to dance with swords.' King Xiang said: 'Yes.' Xiang Zhuang drew his sword and began to dance. Xiang Bo also drew his sword and danced. He constantly used his body to flank and shield Liu Bang. Zhuang could not strike. Therefore Zhang Liang went to the army gate and saw Fan Kuai. Fan Kuai said: 'How are matters today?' Liang said: 'Very urgent. Now Xiang Zhuang draws his sword and dances. His intent is constantly on Liu Bang.' Kuai said: 'This is critical. Your minister requests to enter and share the same fate with him.' Kuai immediately strapped on his sword, embraced his shield, and entered the army gate. The guards with crossed halberds wished to stop him and not admit him. Fan Kuai tilted his shield to collide with them. The guards fell to the ground. Kuai then entered, parted the curtain, stood facing west, glared at King Xiang with his eyes. His hair stood on end, his eyes were completely bloodshot. King Xiang pressed his sword and knelt, saying: 'What is this guest doing?' Zhang Liang said: 'He is Liu Bang's chariot driver, Fan Kuai.' King Xiang said: 'Brave warrior. Grant him a goblet of wine.' They then gave him a large goblet of wine. Kuai bowed in thanks, rose, stood and drank it. King Xiang said: 'Grant him a pork shoulder.' They then gave him a whole pork shoulder. Fan Kuai overturned his shield on the ground, placed the pork shoulder on it, drew his sword, cut it, and ate it. King Xiang said: 'Brave warrior, can you drink more?' Fan Kuai said: 'Your minister would not avoid even death. How could I refuse a goblet of wine! The Qin king has the heart of a tiger or wolf. He kills people as if unable to lift them all, punishes people as if fearing not enough. The world has all rebelled against him. King Huai agreed with the generals that 'Whoever first breaks Qin and enters Xianyang will rule it.' Now Liu Bang first broke Qin and entered Xianyang. He dared not approach even the smallest thing. He sealed the palaces, returned his army to Bashang, and waited for the great king to come. Therefore he sent a general to guard the pass, to prepare for other bandits entering and exiting, and for extraordinary circumstances. To have toiled and achieved such high merit, yet not received the reward of enfeoffment as marquis, and instead listen to petty slander, desiring to execute meritorious people. This is just continuing the ways of perished Qin. I secretly advise the great king not to do this.' King Xiang had nothing to respond with and said: 'Sit.' Fan Kuai sat next to Liang. After sitting a brief moment, Liu Bang rose as if going to the toilet, and took advantage to beckon Fan Kuai out.",

But encountering his anger, I did not dare offer them. You offer them for me.' Zhang Liang said: 'Respectfully, yes.' At this time, King Xiang's army was below Hongmen. Liu Bang's army was at Bashang. They were forty li apart. Liu Bang then abandoned his chariot and cavalry. He escaped alone on horseback with Fan Kuai, Xiahou Ying, Jin Qiang, and Ji Xin—these four men carrying swords and shields—walking on foot. They went from below Mount Li, taking the road through Zhiyang. Liu Bang said to Zhang Liang: 'From this road to my army, it's not over twenty li.

Zhang Liang entered and apologized, saying: 'Liu Bang was overcome by the wine and could not take leave. Respectfully, your minister Liang presents a pair of white jade discs. I twice bow and offer them to the great king's feet; A pair of jade goblets. I twice bow and present them to the great general's feet.' King Xiang said: 'Where is Liu Bang?' Liang said: 'He heard the great king intended to blame him. He escaped alone and left. He has already arrived at his army.' King Xiang then received the jade disc and placed it on his seat. Yafu received the jade goblet, placed it on the ground, drew his sword, struck it, and broke it, saying: 'Alas! This youngster is not worth planning with.

Yet those who personally wore armor and wielded sharp weapons, who first began the matters and were exposed in the wilds for three years, who extinguished Qin and settled the world—all were through the strength of you various lords generals and ministers with me, Ji. The Righteous Emperor, though he has no merit, should therefore have his lands divided and be made king of them.' All the generals said: 'Good.' He then divided the world and established the various generals as marquises and kings. King Xiang and Fan Zeng suspected Liu Bang would take the world. They had already reconciled, but moreover hated to break the agreement and feared the feudal lords would rebel against him. They then secretly planned, saying: 'The Ba and Shu roads are dangerous. Qin's banished people all reside in Shu.' He then said: 'Ba and Shu are also Guanzhong territory.' Therefore he established Liu Bang as Han King, to rule Ba, Shu, and Hanzhong, with his capital at Nanzheng. He divided Guanzhong into three parts and enfeoffed Qin surrendered generals to block and bar the Han King. King Xiang then established Zhang Han as Yong King, to rule west of Xianyang, with his capital at Feiqiu. Chief Clerk Xin had formerly been a Queyang prison clerk and once shown virtue to Xiang Liang; Commandery Captain Dong Yi had originally advised Zhang Han to surrender to Chu. Therefore he established Sima Xin as Sai King, to rule from Xianyang east to the river, with his capital at Queyang; He established Dong Yi as Di King, to rule Shang commandery, with his capital at Gaonu. He moved King Wei Bao to become West Wei King, to rule Hedong, with his capital at Pingyang. Xiaqiu's Shen Yang was Zhang Er's favorite minister. He first submitted Henan commandery and welcomed Chu on the river. Therefore he established Shen Yang as Henan King, with his capital at Luoyang. King Han Cheng kept his old capital, with his capital at Yangdi. Zhao general Sima Ang pacified Henan and had merit several times. Therefore he established Ang as Yin King, to rule Henan, with his capital at Zhaoge. He moved King Zhao Xie to become Dai King. Zhao chancellor Zhang Er was originally worthy and moreover followed into the passes. Therefore he established Er as Changshan King, to rule Zhao territory, with his capital at Xiangguo. Lord Dangyang Qing Bu was a Chu general and constantly the champion. Therefore he established Bu as Jiujiang King, with his capital at Liu. Lord Po Wu Rui led the hundred Yue to assist the feudal lords and moreover followed into the passes. Therefore he established Rui as Hengshan King, with his capital at Zhu. The Righteous Emperor's supreme pillar of state Gong Ao led troops to strike Nan commandery. His merit was great, so he established Ao as Linjiang King, with his capital at Jiangling. He moved King Yan Han Guang to become Liaodong King. Yan general Zang Tu followed Chu to rescue Zhao and moreover followed into the passes. Therefore he established Tu as Yan King, with his capital at Ji. He moved King Qi Tian Shi to become Jiaodong King. Qi general Tian Du followed to rescue Zhao together and moreover followed into the passes. Therefore he established Du as Qi King, with his capital at Linzi. Tian An was the grandson of the Qi King Jian whom Qin had extinguished. Xiang Yu was just crossing the river to rescue Zhao when Tian An submitted several Jibei cities and led his troops to surrender to Xiang Yu. Therefore he established An as Jibei King, with his capital at Boyang. Tian Rong had several times betrayed Xiang Liang and moreover was not willing to lead troops to follow Chu in striking Qin. For this reason he was not enfeoffed. Lord Cheng'an Chen Yu abandoned his general's seal and left, did not follow into the passes. Yet he was originally known as worthy and had merit to Zhao. He heard he was at Nanpi, so accordingly he enfeoffed him with three surrounding counties. Lord Fan's general Mei Dun had great merit, so he enfeoffed him as marquis of one hundred thousand households. King Xiang self-established as Western Chu Hegemon King, ruling nine commanderies, with his capital at Pengcheng.",

Now to release and not strike—this is what is called 'raising a tiger that leaves calamity for oneself.' Han King listened to it. In Han's fifth year, Han King then pursued King Xiang to south of Yangxia. He stopped his army and agreed to meet with Marquis Huaiyin Han Xin and Marquis Jiancheng Peng Yue to strike the Chu army. They arrived at Guling, but Xin and Yue's troops did not assemble. Chu struck the Han army and greatly defeated it. Han King again entered the fortifications, dug deep moats, and defended himself. He said to Zhang Zifang: 'The feudal lords do not follow the agreement. What should I do?' He replied: 'Chu's troops are about to be broken. Xin and Yue do not yet have divided lands. Their not coming is certainly appropriate. If the lord king is able to share and divide the world with them, it can be achieved immediately now. If not able, matters are not yet knowable. If the lord king is able to give from Chen east reaching the sea, completely to Han Xin; From Suiyang north to Gucheng, to give to Peng Yue: make each fight for themselves, then Chu will be easy to defeat.' Han King said: 'Good.' Therefore he then sent envoys to tell Han Xin and Peng Yue: 'Combine your strength to strike Chu. When Chu is broken, from Chen east reaching the sea to give to the Qi King, from Suiyang north to Gucheng to give to Chancellor Peng.' The envoys arrived. Han Xin and Peng Yue all replied: 'We request to advance troops now.' Han Xin then went from Qi. Liu Jia's army went together from Shouchun, slaughtered Chengfu, and arrived at Gaixia. Grand Marshal Zhou Yin rebelled against Chu. With Shu he slaughtered Liu, raised the Jiujiang troops, and followed Liu Jia and Peng Yue. They all assembled at Gaixia and went to King Xiang.",

I wish the great king to urgently cross. Now only your minister has a boat. When the Han army arrives, there will be nothing to cross with.' King Xiang laughed and said: 'Heaven destroys me. Why should I cross! Moreover, I, Ji, crossed the river west with eight thousand Jiangdong sons. Now not one returns. Even if the Jiangdong fathers and elders pity me and make me king, what face would I have to see them? Even if they do not speak, would I, Ji, alone not be ashamed in my heart?' He then said to the pavilion chief: 'I know you are an elder. I have ridden this horse for five years. Those it faced had no enemy. Once it traveled a thousand li in one day. I cannot bear to kill it. I bestow it to you.' He then ordered all the riders to dismount and walk, holding short weapons for close battle. Alone, what I, Ji, killed were several hundred Han soldiers. King Xiang's body also suffered more than ten wounds. He looked back and saw the Han cavalry adjutant Lu Matong. He said: 'Are you not my old friend?' Matong faced him and pointed to Wang Yi, saying: 'This is King Xiang.' King Xiang then said: 'I heard Han offers a thousand gold for my head and a fief of ten thousand households. I will show you virtue.' He then cut his own throat and died. Wang Yi took his head. The remaining riders mutually trampled and contended for King Xiang. Those who mutually killed were several dozen people. Finally, the court gentleman rider Yang Xi, cavalry adjutant Lu Matong, court gentleman Lu Sheng, and Yang Wu each got one part of his body. The five people together assembled his body. It was all correct. Therefore they divided his lands into five: enfeoffed Lu Matong as Lord Zhongshui, enfeoffed Wang Yi as Lord Duyan, enfeoffed Yang Xi as Lord Chiquan, enfeoffed Yang Wu as Lord Wufang, enfeoffed Lu Sheng as Lord Nieyang.",

          "literal": "The Grand Scribe said: I heard from Zhou Sheng that 'Shun's eyes were probably double-pupiled.' I also heard that Xiang Yu was double-pupiled. Was Yu perhaps his descendant? What a fierce rise! Qin lost its governance. Chen She first rebelled. Heroes swarmed and rose. They mutually united and contended. They cannot be counted. Yet Yu had not an inch of land. He rode the plow and rose from the middle of the fields. In three years, he then led the five feudal lords to extinguish Qin, split the world, and enfeoffed kings and marquises. Government came from Yu. He was titled 'Hegemon King.' Though his position did not last, since near ancient times there has never been such. When Yu turned against the passes and longed for Chu, banished the Righteous Emperor and self-established, resented that kings and marquises rebelled against him—it was difficult. He self-boasted of his merits and achievements. He exerted his private wisdom and did not follow the ancients. He considered the hegemon king's enterprise and wished to manage the world with force and conquest. In five years he finally perished his state. His body died at Dongcheng. He still did not become aware and awake, and did not blame himself. It was a mistake. He then cited 'Heaven destroys me, it is not the crime of using troops.' How is this not mistaken!",
