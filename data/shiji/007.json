Chen Ying was a former Dongyang magistrate's secretary. He resided in the county, was originally trustworthy and careful, called an elder. The Dongyang youths killed their magistrate, mutually gathered several thousand people. They wished to establish a leader. None was suitable. They then requested Chen Ying. Ying declined he could not. They then strongly established Ying as leader. The county followers obtained twenty thousand people. The youths wished to establish Ying directly as king, with different army dark heads specially rising. Chen Ying's mother said to Ying: 'Since I became your family's woman, I have never heard that your ancestors had noble ones. Now you have suddenly obtained a great name. This is not auspicious. It is not as good as having a belonging. If matters succeed, you can still obtain enfeoffment as marquis. If matters fail, it is easy to flee. You will not be what the world points to by name.' Ying then did not dare to be king. He said to his army officials: 'The Xiang clan is generation after generation a general's family, has name in Chu. Now we wish to raise great matters. If the general is not the right person, it is not possible. I rely on the famous clan. Perishing Qin is certain.' Thereupon the crowd followed his words and attached their troops to Xiang Liang.

He saw the Chu king and said: 'Song Yi predicted that Lord Wuxin's army would certainly be defeated. Several days later, the army was indeed defeated. He foresaw the signs of defeat before the troops even fought. This can be called true knowledge of warfare.' The king summoned Song Yi to discuss matters and was greatly pleased with him. Therefore he appointed him as supreme general, Xiang Yu as Duke of Lu and deputy general, Fan Zeng as rear general, to rescue Zhao. All the other generals were subordinated to Song Yi, who was titled Champion Marquis. They marched to Anyang but stayed there forty-six days without advancing. Xiang Yu said: 'I hear that Qin's army is surrounding King Zhao at Julu. We should quickly lead our troops across the river. Chu will strike from the outside, Zhao will respond from the inside. Breaking Qin's army is certain.' Song Yi said: 'Not so. One cannot defeat lice and ticks by fighting horseflies on an ox. Now Qin is attacking Zhao. If they win, their troops will be weary. We can inherit their exhaustion; If they don't win, then we lead our troops beating drums westward and will certainly take Qin. Therefore it is better to first let Qin and Zhao fight each other. When it comes to wearing armor and wielding sharp weapons, I am not as good as you; But when it comes to sitting and directing strategy, you are not as good as I.' Therefore he issued an order in the army saying: 'Those fierce as tigers, stubborn as sheep, greedy as wolves, who are strong but cannot be used—all shall be beheaded.' He then sent his son Song Xiang as prime minister of Qi. He personally escorted him to Wuyan and held grand drinking parties. The weather was bitterly cold with heavy rain. The soldiers were freezing and starving. Xiang Yu said: 'We are supposed to unite our strength to attack Qin, but we stay here for a long time without moving. This year brings famine and poverty to the people. Our soldiers eat only taros and beans. The army has no visible stores of grain. Yet he drinks wine and holds grand gatherings. He doesn't lead troops across the river to rely on Zhao's food supplies and combine forces with Zhao to attack Qin. Instead he says 'inherit their fatigue'. Given Qin's strength attacking the newly established Zhao, their momentum will certainly take Zhao. If Zhao falls and Qin remains strong, what fatigue will there be to inherit! Moreover, our state's troops have been newly broken. The king cannot sit at ease. He has swept the entire realm and placed it exclusively under the general. The state's safety or danger rests on this one action. Now he does not pity the soldiers but follows his private interests. He is not a minister of the state altars.' Xiang Yu went to the morning audience with Supreme General Song Yi, and immediately in his tent beheaded Song Yi. He issued an order in the army saying: 'Song Yi conspired with Qi to rebel against Chu. The Chu king secretly ordered me to execute him.' At this time, all the generals trembled and submitted. None dared to oppose. They all said: 'The ones who first established Chu were the general's family. Now the general has executed the rebel.' They then mutually agreed to establish Yu as acting supreme general. They sent people to pursue Song Yi's son. They caught up with him in Qi and killed him.

There is nothing that can be done below. If we win battles now, Gao will quickly envy my merit; If we cannot win battles, we cannot avoid death. I hope the general will carefully consider this.'

He pursued the Rong people north, opened up several thousand li of Yuzhong land, yet was finally beheaded at Yangzhou. Why? Their merits were too many.

He forged a letter from King Huai saying: 'Whoever attacks Qin first, their general will be made King of Western Chu.' Xiang Yu then first crossed the Yellow River, sank boats, smashed cooking pots, burned tents, only carried three days rations, to show determination to fight to the death. The army numbered twenty-eight thousand men, all Chu warriors, attacked Qin at Xin'an. When the Chu army reached, the Qin army was still besieging Zhao at Julu.",

The princes' armies cut paths, Xiang Yu feared they would take advantage, secretly ordered the strong Chu army to follow behind and kill them. When the princes' armies entered the passes, Xiang Yu sealed the passes, did not let them enter. He stationed troops to guard the passes, then led the Chu army west alone. When Xiang Yu reached Hangu Pass, the Qin forces were still many. Xiang Yu attacked, defeated Qin, entered Hangu Pass. King Yi though without merit, should still divide land and make him king.' The generals all said: 'Good.' Then divided the world, established the generals as marquises and kings. Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng suspected Liu Bang of having ambitions for the world, but having already made peace, and fearing to break the agreement and cause the lords to rebel, secretly plotted saying: 'The roads to Ba and Shu are dangerous, Qin's exiled people all live in Shu.' Then said: 'Ba and Shu are also Guanzhong territory.' Therefore established Liu Bang as Han King, ruling Ba, Shu, Hanzhong, with capital at Nanzheng. And divided Guanzhong into three, made Qin surrendering generals kings to block Han King. Xiang Yu then established Zhang Han as Yong King, ruling west of Xianyang, with capital at Feiqiu. Chief Scribe Xin was formerly Queyang prison clerk, once had kindness to Xiang Liang; Colonel Dong Yi originally advised Zhang Han to surrender to Chu. Therefore established Sima Xin as Sai King, ruling east of Xianyang to the Yellow River, with capital at Queyang; Established Dong Yi as Di King, ruling Shangjun, with capital at Gao. When the division was completed, Xiang Yu wished to march east. He camped at Gaixia, and the Han King Liu Bang attacked him. Xiang Yu said: 'Our army has fought for three years, killed generals, crossed passes, taken cities, but the enemy is many and we are few.' He sent Long Ju to ask Han Xin to attack Qi. Han Xin said: 'The overlord is in danger, I cannot abandon him.' Xiang Yu then sent Wu She to persuade Han Xin. Wu She said: 'You and the overlord both Chu people, but you became king of Qi. Now the overlord is in danger, but you do not help, this is disloyal.' Han Xin said: 'The overlord once made me king, I am grateful. But I have heard that if the mother is kind, the son is filial; if the lord is enlightened, the minister is loyal. Now the overlord treats me with suspicion and sends someone else, this shows he does not trust me.' Wu She returned and told Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu sent Ji Xin to attack Qi. Ji Xin attacked Qi, Han Xin defended Qi. Han Xin said: 'Ji Xin is brave but not strategic, I can defeat him.' Han Xin lured Ji Xin into a trap, captured him. Han Xin then attacked Chu, defeated Xiang Yu at Gaixia. Xiang Yu retreated to Dongcheng.",
