          "text": "Chancellor Chen Ping, Grand Commandant Zhou Bo and others sent people to welcome the King of Dai. The King of Dai consulted with his attendants, the Zhongwei Zhang Wu and others. Zhang Wu and others advised: 'All the Han ministers are old generals of Gaozu's time, skilled in military affairs and full of cunning stratagems, this is not just their intention to do this, they merely fear the authority of Gaozu and Empress Lu. Now that they have already killed the Lü clan and shed fresh blood in the capital, this welcoming Your Majesty is just a pretext, in reality it cannot be trusted.' 'We urge Your Majesty to feign illness and not go, to observe how events develop.' Zhongwei Hong Chang advanced and said: 'The ministers' discussions are all wrong. When Qin lost its governance, the various feudal lords and powerful families rose up one by one, each considering himself to have the Mandate of Heaven, the number who considered themselves worthy reached tens of thousands, yet in the end, the one who ascended the imperial throne was Liu Bang, the world despaired, this is the first reason. Gaozu enfeoffed his sons and younger brothers with lands in a chessboard pattern to check each other, this is called the rock-solid foundation, the world respects its strength, this is the second reason. The Han rose and abolished Qin's harsh laws, simplified the statutes, bestowed kindness and favor, everyone felt at ease, difficult to shake, this is the third reason. Although Empress Lu was strict and established three Lü as kings, monopolizing power and controlling everything, yet Grand Commandant Zhou Bo entered the Northern Army with a single tally, one shout and the soldiers all bared their left arms, supporting the Liu clan and rebelling against the Lü, in the end exterminating them. This was bestowed by Heaven, not by human effort. Now if the ministers truly intend to rebel, the people will not support them, how can their party become unified?' At present, internally we have the relatives Zhu Hui and Dong Mu, externally we fear the strength of Wu, Chu, Huainan, Langye, Qi, and Dai.' 'At present, among Gaozu's sons, only the Kings of Huainan and Dai remain, moreover Your Majesty is the elder, sage, benevolent, and filial, renowned throughout the world, therefore the ministers, following the will of the world, wish to welcome and establish Your Majesty, Your Majesty should have no doubts.' The King of Dai reported this to the Empress Dowager, but still hesitated and could not decide. He divined with tortoise shell, the omen showed 'Great Horizontal'. The interpretation said: 'Great Horizontal Geng Geng, I am the Heavenly King, Xia Yu illuminated it.' The King of Dai said: 'I am already a king, why speak of being king again?' The diviner said: 'What is called Heavenly King is the Son of Heaven.' Thereupon the King of Dai sent his mother's younger brother Bo Zhao to see Marquis Jiang, Jiang Hou and others fully explained to Zhao the intention of welcoming and establishing the king. Bo Zhao returned and reported: 'It is true, there is no need to doubt.' The King of Dai then laughed and said to Hong Chang: 'Indeed as you said.' He ordered Hong Chang to ride in the same carriage, Zhang Wu and five others to ride in the post carriage, and set out for Chang'an. They halted at Gaoling, and sent Hong Chang to first go to Chang'an to observe the situation.",
