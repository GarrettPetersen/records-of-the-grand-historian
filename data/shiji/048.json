          "literal": "In the first year of the Second Emperor's reign, seventh month, they conscripted the lower classes to serve at the garrison in Yuyang, and 900 men were stationed at Daze Township. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang were both selected to go and made company commanders. Just then there was a great rainstorm, the roads became impassable, and they realized they would miss their deadline. Missing the deadline meant execution by law. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang then conspired, saying: 'Now, fleeing means death, but starting a great enterprise also means death. Since death is certain either way, why not die for our country?' Chen Sheng said: 'The world has suffered under Qin rule for a long time. I have heard that the Second Emperor is the younger son and should not have ascended. The one who should have been emperor is Prince Fusu.' Because Fusu frequently remonstrated, the First Emperor sent him to command troops on the frontier. Now it is rumored that he was innocent, but the Second Emperor killed him. The common people have heard much of his virtue, but do not know he is dead. Xiang Yan was a Chu general who achieved many victories, loved his soldiers, and the Chu people pitied him. Some think he is dead, others think he has fled. Now if we use our forces to falsely claim to be Prince Fusu and Xiang Yan, and start the uprising for all under heaven, many should respond to us.' Wu Guang agreed. So they consulted an oracle. The diviner knew their intentions and said: 'Your affairs will all succeed and you will achieve merit. However, you are consulting the spirits!' Chen Sheng and Wu Guang were delighted, thinking about the spirits, and said: 'This teaches us to first awe the masses.' So they wrote in cinnabar on silk 'Chen Sheng will be king' and placed it in the belly of a fish someone was netting. The soldiers bought the fish and cooked it, finding the writing in the belly, and were already amazed by it. They also forced Wu Guang to go to the shrine in the bushes by their camp, where at night he lit torches and imitated a fox's cry shouting 'Great Chu rises, Chen Sheng will be king.' The soldiers were all frightened that night. The next day, the soldiers whispered among themselves, all pointing at Chen Sheng.",

The Chen king was angry, arrested Wu Chen and others' families, wanting to execute them. The Grand Marshal said: 'While Qin has not yet perished, executing the Zhao king's generals' and chancellors' families—this creates another Qin. Better to acknowledge and confirm their positions.' The Chen king then sent envoys to congratulate Zhao, moved Wu Chen and others' families into the palace, and enfeoffed Zhang Er's son Zhang Ao as Lord of Chengdu, urging the Zhao troops to quickly enter the pass. The Zhao king's generals and chancellors consulted together, saying: 'To king ourselves over Zhao was not Chu's intention. If Chu destroys Qin, they will surely turn their troops against Zhao. The best plan is not to send troops west, but to send envoys north to take Yan territory and expand ourselves. Zhao controls the Yellow River to the south and will have Yan and Dai to the north. Even if Chu defeats Qin, they won't dare control Zhao. If Chu doesn't defeat Qin, they will certainly value Zhao. Zhao can take advantage of Qin's exhaustion and achieve its ambitions under heaven.' The Zhao king agreed, so they didn't send troops west, but sent the former county clerk of Shanggu, Han Guang, to lead troops north to take Yan territory.",

South he took the land of Baiyue, making Guilin and Xiang commanderies, the Baiyue lords bowed their heads and bound their necks, entrusting their fate to lowly officials. He had Meng Tian build the Great Wall north to guard the frontier, repelling the Xiongnu seven hundred li, the barbarians dared not come south to graze their horses, soldiers dared not draw their bows to avenge grievances. Thus he discarded the former kings' way, burned the hundred schools' writings, to make the common people foolish. He demolished famous cities, killed outstanding men, gathered the world's weapons in Xianyang, melted the sharp blades and cast twelve golden statues, to weaken the world's people. Then he trampled Mount Hua as his city wall, used the river as his moat, occupied the hundred-thousand-zhang city, overlooking the unfathomable gorge for security. Good generals and strong crossbows guarded strategic places, trusted ministers and elite troops displayed sharp weapons and challenged intruders.
