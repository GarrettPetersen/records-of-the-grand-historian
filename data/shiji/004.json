King Wu sent Grand Preceptor Shangfu with the hundred commanders to engage the enemy, charging with large forces at Emperor Zhou's army. Though Zhou's army was numerous, none had the will to fight; in their hearts they wanted King Wu to enter quickly. Zhou's troops all reversed their weapons to fight, thereby opening the way for King Wu. King Wu charged at them, and Zhou's soldiers all collapsed and defected from Zhou. Zhou fled, returned and climbed to the top of Deer Terrace, wrapped himself in his precious jade, and immolated himself in fire and died. King Wu held the great white banner to signal to the feudal lords; all the feudal lords bowed to King Wu, and King Wu then saluted the feudal lords, and all the feudal lords followed. When King Wu reached the state of Shang, all the people of Shang were waiting in the outskirts. Thereupon King Wu had his ministers announce to the people of Shang: \"Heaven above has bestowed blessings!\"  The people of Shang all bowed twice and touched their foreheads to the ground, and King Wu also bowed in return. He then proceeded inward and reached the place where Zhou had died. King Wu personally shot at him; after three arrows he descended from his chariot, struck him with a light sword, severed Zhou's head with a yellow battle-axe, and hung it on a great white banner. Then he came to Zhou's two favorite concubines; both women had hanged themselves. King Wu again shot three arrows, struck them with his sword, severed their heads with a black battle-axe, and hung them on a small white banner. After this, King Wu went out and returned to the army.",

He ordered Nangong Kuo and Shi Yi to display the Nine Tripods and precious jade. He ordered Hong Yao to build a mound over Bigan's tomb. He ordered the ancestral priests to make offerings and sacrifices to the army. He then disbanded the army and returned westward. He conducted an inspection tour, recorded the governmental affairs, and composed the \"Martial Success.\" He enfeoffed feudal lords, distributed ancestral ritual vessels, and composed the \"Division of Yin's Vessels.\" King Wu, reflecting on the former sage kings, honored and enfeoffed the descendants of Shennong at Jiao, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor at Zhu, the descendants of Emperor Yao at Ji, the descendants of Emperor Shun at Chen, and the descendants of the Great Yu at Qi. Thereupon he enfeoffed the meritorious ministers and advisors, with Grand Preceptor Shangfu receiving the first enfeoffment. He enfeoffed Shangfu at Yingqiu, calling it Qi.

          "text": "When King Mu was about to attack the Quanrong, Jigong Moufu remonstrated, saying: \"You cannot. The former kings displayed virtue, not military force. Military force should be restrained and only used at appropriate times; when used it inspires awe, when displayed it becomes familiar, and when familiar it loses its power to intimidate. Therefore the ode of Zhou Wengong says: 'We put away shields and spears, we sheathe bows and arrows, I seek beautiful virtue, spread it in the great Xia, and the king truly preserves it.'  The former kings, in dealing with the people, cultivated and rectified their virtue and enriched their nature, multiplied their wealth and made their implements useful, clarified what was beneficial and harmful, cultivated them with civil culture, made them pursue benefit and avoid harm, cherish virtue and fear authority; therefore they were able to preserve their reigns and grow ever greater. In former times our ancestors for generations, from Houji onward, served Yu and Xia. When Xia declined, they abandoned the office of Ji and did not attend to it; our ancestor Buzhu thus lost his office and fled to hide among the Rong and Di. Not daring to neglect his duties, he continually cultivated his virtue, followed and maintained his heritage, cultivated his teachings and laws, morning and evening was respectfully diligent, guarded with sincerity and loyalty, and served with faithful devotion. Through successive generations they carried on virtue, not shaming their predecessors. When it came to King Wen and King Wu, they illuminated the brilliance of their predecessors and added to it compassion and harmony, served the spirits and protected the people, and all were joyful. King Di Xin of Shang greatly wronged the people; the common people could not bear it and joyfully supported King Wu, thereby bringing the army to the fields of Shang. Therefore the former kings did not pursue military affairs, but encouraged concern for the people's suffering and eliminated their harm. The former kings' system was: within the state was the dian service zone, outside the state was the hou service zone, beyond the hou was the bin service zone, the Yi and Man were the yao service zone, and the Rong and Di were the huang service zone. The dian zone performed sacrifices, the hou zone performed ancestral offerings, the bin zone presented tributes, the yao zone brought contributions, and the huang zone acknowledged the king. Daily sacrifices, monthly offerings, seasonal presentations, yearly contributions, and lifelong acknowledgment of the king. In the former kings' proper ritual system, if there were no sacrifices they cultivated goodwill, if no offerings they cultivated speech, if no presentations they cultivated civil culture, if no contributions they cultivated reputation, if no acknowledgment of the king they cultivated virtue, and only if the order was established and some still did not come did they apply punishments. Thus there was punishment for not sacrificing, attack for not offering, expedition for not presenting, admonishment for not contributing, and proclamation for not acknowledging the king. Thus there were punishments and penalties, there were attacking and punitive troops, there were expeditionary preparations, there were threatening and yielding commands, there were civil announcements and statements. If after issuing orders and making proclamations some still did not come, they would further cultivate virtue and not trouble the people with distant campaigns. Therefore those near all obeyed, and those far all submitted. Now since the end of Dabi and Boshi, the Quanrong have come to acknowledge the king with their duties, yet the Son of Heaven says 'I must attack them for not presenting tributes, and display military force to them'; would this not abandon the teachings of the former kings and bring the king near to ruin? I have heard that the Quanrong are sincere and honest, follow ancient virtue, and remain purely steadfast; they will have the means to resist us.\"  The king nevertheless attacked them, obtained four white wolves and four white deer, and returned. From this time on, those in the huang service zone did not come.",

The crown prince's mother was a daughter of the Marquis of Shen and had become queen. Later when King You obtained Bao Si, he loved her and wanted to depose Queen Shen, also removing Crown Prince Yijiu, making Bao Si the queen and Bofu the crown prince. The Grand Historian of Zhou, Boyang, read the historical records and said: \"Zhou will perish.\"  Long ago when the Xia declined, two divine dragons appeared in the court of the Xia emperor and said: 'We are the two lords of Bao.'  The Xia emperor divined whether to kill them, drive them away, or keep them; none was auspicious. He divined about requesting their saliva and storing it; this was auspicious. Thereupon he presented ritual gifts and made an announcement with divination tablets; the dragons disappeared but the saliva remained, and he put it in a box and stored it away. When Xia perished, this vessel was transmitted to Yin. When Yin perished, this vessel was again transmitted to Zhou. Throughout all three dynasties, none dared to open it; until the end of King Li's reign, when it was opened and examined. The saliva flowed in the courtyard and could not be removed. King Li had women strip naked and shout at it. The saliva transformed into a black turtle and entered the king's rear palace. A young maid in the rear palace encountered it when she had lost her baby teeth, became pregnant when she came of age, and gave birth to a child without a husband; frightened, she abandoned it. In King Xuan's time, young girls sang a ditty: 'A bow of wild mulberry and quiver of wicker will truly destroy the Zhou state.'
