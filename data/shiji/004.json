King Wu planned it, King Cheng sent Shao Gong to divine the site, placed the nine tripods there, and Zhou again made its capital at Feng and Hao. Until the Quanrong defeated King You, Zhou then moved east to Luoyi. What is called 'Zhou Gong buried me at Bi', Bi is in the Du midst southeast of Hao. Qin extinguished Zhou. After Han arose, ninety-some years passed, the Son of Heaven was about to seal Taishan, toured east to Henan, sought Zhou descendants, enfeoffed their posterity Jia with thirty li of land, titled Zhou Zi Nan Jun, ranked as liehou, to continue their ancestral sacrifices.",
