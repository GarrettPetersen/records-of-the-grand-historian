The emperor had already bent the meritorious officials and given Xiao He much in enfeoffment, but regarding rank order he had no way to rebut the difficulty, yet in his heart he wanted He to be first. Marquis within the Passes E Jun advanced and said: 'All the ministers' discussions are mistaken. Although Cao Can has the merit of campaigning and seizing territory in the wilds, this is just a temporary matter. The emperor has confronted Chu for five years, frequently losing armies and troops, escaping and fleeing several times. Yet Xiao He constantly sent armies from Guanzhong to fill the gaps, not summoned by the emperor's edicts, and tens of thousands gathered to supply what the emperor lacked several times. Han and Chu confronted each other at Xingyang for several years, the army had no visible grain, but Xiao He transported grain from Guanzhong, never lacking in provisions. Although the emperor several times lost Shandong, Xiao He always kept Guanzhong intact to wait for the emperor—this is merit for ten thousand generations. Now even if we lacked a hundred Cao Cans, what harm would it do to Han? Han obtaining them is not necessary for completeness.' How can one want to add merit for ten thousand generations with merit from a single day! Xiao He first, Cao Can second.' Gaozu said: 'Good.' Thus he ordered Xiao He [first], granting him the right to wear sword and shoes while ascending the hall, and not to hasten when entering court.",
