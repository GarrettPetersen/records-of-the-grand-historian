Duke Xiao having seen Wei Yang, spoke of affairs for a long time, Duke Xiao frequently dozed off, did not listen. Retiring, Duke Xiao angrily rebuked Jing Jian: 'Your guest is a charlatan, how can he be employed!' Jing Jian relayed this to Wei Yang.

Yang again saw Duke Xiao, spoke even better, but still not to his liking. Retiring, Duke Xiao again rebuked Jing Jian, Jing Jian also rebuked Yang. Yang said: 'I advised him with the way of the king but it did not enter. Please let me see him again.' Yang again saw Duke Xiao, Duke Xiao approved but did not yet employ him. Retiring and leaving. Duke Xiao told Jing Jian: 'Your guest is good, one can converse with him.' Yang said: 'I advised him with the way of hegemony, his intention desires to employ it. If he truly sees me again, I will know it.' Wei Yang again saw Duke Xiao. The duke conversed with him, unconsciously slid forward on the mat. Spoke for several days without tiring.
