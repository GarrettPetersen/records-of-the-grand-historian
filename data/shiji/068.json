Duke Xiao having seen Wei Yang, spoke of affairs for a long time, Duke Xiao frequently dozed off, did not listen. Retiring, Duke Xiao angrily rebuked Jing Jian: 'Your guest is a charlatan, how can he be employed!' Jing Jian relayed this to Wei Yang. Wei Yang said: 'I advised him with the way of the emperor, his will is not enlightened.' After five days, he again sought to see Yang. Yang again saw Duke Xiao, spoke even better, but still not to his liking. Retiring, Duke Xiao again rebuked Jing Jian, Jing Jian also rebuked Yang. Yang said: 'I advised him with the way of the king but it did not enter. Please let me see him again.' Yang again saw Duke Xiao, Duke Xiao approved but did not yet employ him. Retiring and leaving. Duke Xiao told Jing Jian: 'Your guest is good, one can converse with him.' Yang said: 'I advised him with the way of hegemony, his intention desires to employ it. If he truly sees me again, I will know it.' Wei Yang again saw Duke Xiao. The duke conversed with him, unconsciously slid forward on the mat. Spoke for several days without tiring. Jing Jian said: 'How did you hit upon our lord's pleasure? Our lord's delight is extreme.'

Wei Yang said: 'Doubtful actions have no reputation, doubtful affairs have no merit. Moreover those who practice superior conduct are surely criticized by the age; Those with unique wisdom are surely scorned by the people. Fools are dark about completed affairs, wise men see things at their inception. The people cannot be consulted about beginnings but can enjoy successes. Those who discuss supreme virtue do not harmonize with custom, those who accomplish great merit do not consult the multitude. Therefore sages if they can strengthen the state, do not follow old laws; If they can benefit the people, do not follow old rituals.' Duke Xiao said: \"Good.\" Gan Long said: \"Not so. Sages do not change the people and teach, wise men do not alter laws and govern. Following the people and teaching, without labor succeeds; Following laws and governing, officials are familiar and people at peace with them.\" Wei Yang said: \"What Long says is the talk of common customs. Ordinary people are at peace with old customs, scholars drown in what they have heard. With these two occupying office and keeping laws is acceptable, but not for discussing beyond the laws. The Three Dynasties differed in ritual yet became kings, the Five Hegemons differed in law yet became hegemons. Wise men create laws, fools are restricted by them; Worthy men change rituals, worthless men are bound by them.\" Du Zhi said: \"Benefit not a hundredfold, do not change law; Merit not tenfold, do not change implements. Following antiquity has no fault, following ritual has no error.\" Wei Yang said: \"Governing the age is not one way, benefiting the state does not follow antiquity. Therefore Tang and Wu did not follow antiquity and became kings, Xia and Yin did not change ritual and perished. Those who oppose antiquity cannot be criticized, those who follow ritual are not worth praising.\" Duke Xiao said: \"Good.\" Employed Wei Yang as Left Senior Chamberlain, finally established the change law edict.",

Wei sent Gongzi Ang to lead and attack him. Armies having confronted, Wei Yang sent letter to Wei general Gongzi Ang: \"I initially was friendly with Gongzi, now both serve as generals of two states, cannot bear to attack each other, can meet Gongzi face to face, form alliance, joyfully drink and cease hostilities, to pacify Qin and Wei.\" Wei Gongzi Ang considered it correct. Alliance meeting completed, drinking, Wei Yang ambushed armored soldiers and attacked captured Wei Gongzi Ang, then attacked his army, completely defeated it and returned to Qin. Wei Hui Wang troops repeatedly defeated by Qi and Qin, state internally empty, daily diminishing, fearful, then sent envoy to cede west of Yellow River territory to Qin to make peace. Wei then left Anyi, moved capital to Da Liang. Liang Hui Wang said: \"I regret not using Gongshu Zuo words.\" Wei Yang having defeated Wei returned, Qin enfeoffed him with Shang fifteen cities, titled Lord Shang.",
