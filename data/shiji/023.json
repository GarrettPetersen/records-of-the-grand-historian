Coming to Gaozu, he possessed the four seas, Shu Sun Tong considerably added to and reduced them, but on the whole they all inherited Qin's old ways. From the emperor's title downward to aides and officials and palace and office names, few were changed. When Filial Wen ascended the throne, the officials discussed wanting to establish ceremonial rites; Filial Wen delighted in Daoist learning, considering elaborate rites and adorned appearances useless for governance, how could personal transformation be done?—thus he dismissed it. In Filial Jing's time, Imperial Secretary Chun Cuo was clear about worldly affairs and legalist names, repeatedly remonstrated Filial Jing saying: 'The nobles are bulwarks, ministers and sons are one example, this is the system of ancient and modern times. Now the great states monopolize different governance, not receiving from the capital, I fear it cannot be transmitted to posterity.' Filial Jing used his plan, and the six states rebelled in defiance, with Cuo as the first named, the Son of Heaven executed Cuo to resolve the difficulty. The matter is in Yuan Ang's biography. After this, officials nourished connections and secured salaries, none dared discuss again.",
