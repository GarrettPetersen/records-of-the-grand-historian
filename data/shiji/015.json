The reason the poems and documents reappeared was that many were hidden in people's homes, but the historical records were stored only in the Zhou court, so they were destroyed. Alas, alas! Only the Qin records remained, but they did not record dates and months, their text was brief and incomplete. Yet the stratagems and changes of the Warring States also have much worth adopting—why must it be ancient times? Qin took the world with much violence, yet eras change, great success was achieved. The tradition says 'Follow later kings,' why is that? Because they are close to us and their customs and changes are similar, their doctrines are humble and easy to implement. Scholars are constrained by what they have heard, seeing Qin in the imperial position for few days, not examining its beginning and end, so they laugh at it, not daring to discuss it—this is no different from eating with the ears. How lamentable!",
