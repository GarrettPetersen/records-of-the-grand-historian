Zou Ji Zi said: 'I respectfully receive the command; I request to carefully repair the laws and oversee corrupt officials.' Chunyu Kun finished speaking, hurried out, reached the gate, and turned to face his charioteer: 'This man—I spoke five subtle words to him, and he responded to me like an echo responds to sound. This man will certainly be enfeoffed before long.' After a season, he was enfeoffed with Xiapi, titled Cheng Hou.",

I have a minister named Tan Zi; when I had him defend Nancheng, the Chu people dared not raid eastward, and the twelve feudal lords above the Si all came to court. I have a minister named Zi; when I had him defend Gaotang, the Zhao people dared not fish eastward on the river. I have an official named Qian Fu; when I had him defend Xuzhou, the Yan people sacrificed at the north gate, the Zhao people at the west gate, and those who moved to follow him numbered over seven thousand households.

          "literal": "In the twelfth year, he attacked Wei. Chu besieged Yongshi, and Qin defeated Qu Gai. Su Dai spoke to Tian Zhen: 'I wish to have an audience with you; this matter is very complete, making Chu benefit you—if successful it becomes fortune, if not it also becomes fortune. Just now as I stood at the gate, a guest said the Wei king told Han Feng and Zhang Yi: 'The cooked jujube is about to be plucked, Qi troops advance again; if you come save me it will be fine; If you do not save me, I cannot pluck it.' This is merely persuasive words. If Qin and Han's troops do not go east, in ten days more, then Wei will turn Han to follow Qin, Qin will drive out Zhang Yi, and join arms to serve Qi and Chu—this will complete your lordship's affair.' Tian Zhen said: 'How to make them not go east?' He replied: 'Han Feng's words about saving Wei will certainly not say to the Han king 'Feng thinks of Wei', but will say 'Feng will use Qin and Han's troops to push back Qi and Song to the east, Feng will gather the three kingdoms' troops, take advantage of Qu Gai's weakness, carve territory from Chu to the south, and certainly regain all the old lands.' Zhang Yi's words about saving Wei will certainly not say to the Qin king 'Yi thinks of Wei', but will say 'Yi will use Qin and Han's troops to resist Qi and Song to the east, Yi will gather the three kingdoms' troops, take advantage of Qu Gai's weakness, carve territory from Chu to the south, nominally to save a perishing kingdom but actually to attack Sanchuan and return—this is kingly enterprise.' Have the Chu king give land to Han, have Qin arrange peace, and tell the Qin king 'Please give land to Han, and Your Majesty bestow it on Sanchuan; Han's troops will not be used but you will gain land from Chu.' What will Han Feng's words about sending troops east say to Qin? He will say 'Qin troops not used but gain Sanchuan, attack Chu and Han to distress Wei, Wei will not dare go east, thus isolating Qi.' What will Zhang Yi's words about sending troops east say? He will say 'Qin and Han desire land but troops are stationed, fame and might issue from Wei, Wei's desire not to lose Qi and Chu will be supported.' Wei will turn Qin and Han to vie in serving Qi and Chu; the Chu king desires this but has no land to give, you make Qin and Han's troops unused yet gain land—there is great virtue in this. The kings of Qin and Han will be coerced by Han Feng and Zhang Yi to send troops east to submit to Wei, you will constantly hold the left tally to demand from Qin and Han—this will be good for you but bad for Zhang Zi, providing much support.'",

Su Dai came from Yan, entered Qi, and was seen at the east gate of Zhanghua Palace. The Qi king said: 'Ah, good, you have come! Qin has sent Wei Ran to confer the title of emperor; what do you think?' He replied: 'Your Majesty's question to me is abrupt, and the source of the trouble is subtle; I wish Your Majesty to accept it but not fully style yourself as such. If Qin styles itself as such and the empire accepts it, then Your Majesty may style yourself as such, with no harm. Moreover, yielding or contending for the emperor title does no harm. If Qin styles itself as such and the empire hates it, Your Majesty should therefore not style yourself as such, to gather the empire—this is great support. Moreover, if the empire establishes two emperors, does Your Majesty think the empire will honor Qi? Or honor Qin?' The king said: 'Honor Qin.' He said: 'If we relinquish the emperor title, will the empire love Qi? Or love Qin?' The king said: 'Love Qi and hate Qin.' He said: 'If the two emperors covenant to attack Zhao, which is more advantageous than attacking the wicked Song?' The king said: 'Attacking the wicked Song is advantageous.' He replied: 'The covenants are equal, yet partnering with Qin as emperor means the empire alone honors Qin and slight Qi; relinquishing the emperor title means the empire loves Qi and hates Qin. Attacking Zhao is not as advantageous as attacking the wicked Song. Therefore I wish Your Majesty to clearly relinquish the emperor title to gather the empire, double-cross the covenant to make Qin our guest, avoid contending for supremacy, and in the interval Your Majesty may take Song. For if we have Song, Wei's southern lands are endangered; If we have the west of Ji, Zhao's eastern dependencies are endangered; If we have the north of Huai, Chu's eastern territories are endangered; If we have Tao and Pinglu, Liang's gates will not open. Relinquish the emperor title and lend this pretext of attacking the wicked Song, the kingdom will be weighty and the name honored, Yan and Chu will submit in form, the empire will dare not disobey—this is the action of Tang and Wu. Respect Qin nominally, then afterward make the empire hate them—this is called using humility to achieve honor. I wish Your Majesty to carefully consider this.' Then Qi relinquished the emperor title and became king again, Qin also relinquished the emperor position.",

Han Nie is my friend, yet you attack what I love—why?' Su Dai, on behalf of Qi, spoke to the Qin king: 'Han Nie's attack on Song is actually for Your Majesty's benefit. If Qi grows strong and is aided by Song, Chu and Wei will certainly fear, and in fear they will certainly serve Qin to the west. This means Your Majesty troubles not one soldier, harms not one warrior, and without effort carves out Anyi—this is what Han Nie prays for from Your Majesty.' The Qin king said: 'I am troubled by Qi's unpredictability. Sometimes allied, sometimes opposed—what explanation is there?' He replied: 'In the empire's commands, is Qi predictable? Qi attacks Song knowing it serves Qin to aid itself with a ten-thousand chariot kingdom; if it does not serve Qin to the west, Song's governance will not be peaceful. The white-haired wandering persuaders of China all accumulate wisdom desiring to separate Qi and Qin's alliance; those hiding crossbows and tying letters galloping west have not one speaking well of Qi; those hiding crossbows and tying letters galloping east have not one speaking well of Qin. Why? All do not desire Qi and Qin's union. How wise are Jin and Chu, how foolish Qi and Qin! When Jin and Chu unite they must plot against Qi and Qin; when Qi and Qin unite they must scheme against Jin and Chu. Please decide affairs with this.' The Qin king said: 'Agreed.' Then Qi proceeded to attack Song; the Song king fled and died at Wen. Qi carved south from Chu the north of Huai, invaded west the three Jin, desiring to annex Zhou and become Son of Heaven. The feudal lords of Zou and Lu above the Si all styled themselves ministers; the feudal lords were fearful.",

At first, Queen Jun was worthy, served Qin cautiously, was trustworthy with the feudal lords, and Qi was also bordered by the eastern sea; Qin attacked the three Jin, Yan, and Chu day and night, and the five kingdoms each defended themselves against Qin, which is why King Jian established himself for over forty years without suffering invasion. After Queen Jun died, Hou Sheng became Qi chancellor, received much Qin gold for espionage, sent many guests into Qin, and Qin gave much gold; the guests all became double agents, advising the king to abandon alliances and court Qin, not prepare for attack and battle, not help the five kingdoms attack Qin, which is why Qin was able to extinguish the five kingdoms. Once the five kingdoms had perished, Qin troops suddenly entered Linzi, and no people dared resist. King Jian then surrendered and was moved to Gong. Therefore Qi people resented King Jian for not early uniting with the feudal lords to attack Qin, listening to treacherous ministers and guests to lose his kingdom, and sang of it: 'Pine or cypress? The one dwelling with Jian in Gong is a guest?' Hating that Jian's use of guests was inauspicious.",
