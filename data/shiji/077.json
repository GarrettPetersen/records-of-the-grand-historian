The prince heard of him and went to invite him, wishing to give him generous gifts. Hou Ying refused to accept, saying: 'I have cultivated myself and purified my conduct for decades. I will never accept the prince's wealth just because I am impoverished as a gatekeeper.' The prince then prepared wine and held a great banquet for his guests. When all were seated, the prince took his chariot and retinue, leaving the left seat empty, and personally went to welcome Hou Sheng of the eastern gate. Hou Sheng adjusted his worn clothes and hat, went straight up and sat in the prince's upper seat without yielding, wishing to observe the prince. The prince held the reins with even greater respect. Hou Sheng then said to the prince: 'I have a friend in the market butcher shop. I wish to trouble your chariot and retinue to pass by there.' The prince drove his chariot into the market. Hou Sheng got down to see his friend Zhu Hai, deliberately standing for a long time, talking with his friend while carefully observing the prince. The prince's expression grew even more gentle. At this time, Wei's generals, ministers, royal clan, and guests filled the hall, waiting for the prince to raise his wine cup. The market people all watched the prince holding the reins. His retinue all secretly cursed Hou Sheng. Hou Sheng saw that the prince's expression never changed, so he took leave of his friend and got into the chariot. When they arrived home, the prince led Hou Sheng to the upper seat and introduced him to all the guests. The guests were all astonished. When the wine flowed freely, the prince rose and toasted Hou Sheng in front. Hou Sheng then said to the prince: 'Today Ying has done enough for the prince.
