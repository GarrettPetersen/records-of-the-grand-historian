Hou Sheng adjusted his worn clothes and hat, went straight up and sat in the prince's upper seat without yielding, wishing to observe the prince. The prince held the reins with even greater respect. Hou Sheng then said to the prince: 'I have a friend in the market butcher shop. I wish to trouble your chariot and retinue to pass by there.' The prince drove his chariot into the market. Hou Sheng got down to see his friend Zhu Hai, deliberately standing for a long time, talking with his friend while carefully observing the prince. The prince's expression grew even more gentle. At this time, Wei's generals, ministers, royal clan, and guests filled the hall, waiting for the prince to raise his wine cup. The market people all watched the prince holding the reins.

The prince's sister was married to Lord Pingyuan, younger brother of King Huiwen of Zhao. She repeatedly sent letters to the King of Wei and the prince, pleading for rescue from Wei. The King of Wei sent General Jin Bi with a force of 100,000 to rescue Zhao. The King of Qin sent an envoy to tell the King of Wei: 'I attack Zhao and will take it in a matter of days. Any feudal lord who dares rescue them—I will first destroy Zhao, then shift my troops to attack them.' The King of Wei was afraid and sent someone to stop Jin Bi, keeping the army encamped at Ye, nominally rescuing Zhao but actually sitting on the fence to wait and see. Lord Pingyuan's envoys came to Wei one after another with coronets and canopies, rebuking Lord Xinling of Wei: 'The reason Sheng attached herself as your relative was because of your noble righteousness, your ability to urgently aid those in distress. Now Handan will fall to Qin any day, yet Wei's rescue does not arrive. Where is your ability to urgently aid those in distress? Even if you disregard Sheng and abandon her to surrender to Qin, do you not pity your own sister?' The prince was troubled by this and repeatedly petitioned the King of Wei, and his retainers and debaters persuaded the king in countless ways. The King of Wei feared Qin and ultimately would not listen to the prince. The prince considered that he could never obtain permission from the king.

What should I make of this?' He wished not to obey. Zhu Hai hid a forty-jin iron hammer in his sleeve and hammered Jin Bi to death. The prince then commanded Jin Bi's army. He rallied the troops and gave orders in the army: 'If father and son are both in the army, the father returns home. If brothers are both in the army, the elder brother returns home. If there are only sons with no brothers, they return home to care for parents.' He obtained 80,000 selected troops and advanced to attack the Qin army. The Qin army withdrew, and Handan was rescued, preserving Zhao. The King of Zhao and Lord Pingyuan personally welcomed the prince at the border. Lord Pingyuan carried a crossbow and arrows, leading the way for the prince. The King of Zhao bowed twice and said: 'Since ancient times, no worthy man has matched the prince.' At this time, Lord Pingyuan did not dare compare himself to others. The prince took leave of Hou Sheng. When he reached the army, Hou Sheng indeed faced north and cut his own throat.",
