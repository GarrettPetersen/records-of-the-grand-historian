Bo gave a thousand jin of gold to the prison officials, the prison officials then wrote on the back of the documents to show him, saying 'Use the princess as witness.' The princess was Emperor Xiaowen's daughter, Bo's heir Shengzhi married her, so the prison officials taught to cite her as witness. Bo's increased enfeoffments and rewards, all gave to Bo Zhao.
