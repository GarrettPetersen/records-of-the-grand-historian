I secretly consider him a brave man with wisdom and strategy, suitable to send.' Thus the king summoned and saw Lin Xiangru, asking: 'The Qin king wishes to exchange fifteen cities for my jade disk. Should I give it or not?' Xiangru said: 'Qin is strong and Zhao weak, cannot but agree.' The king said: 'If they take my jade disk but not give me cities, what then?' Xiangru said: 'If Qin seeks the jade disk with cities but Zhao does not agree, the fault lies with Zhao.' If Zhao gives the jade disk but Qin does not give Zhao cities, the fault lies with Qin.' Between these two strategies, better to agree and let Qin bear the fault.' The king said: 'Who can be sent?' Xiangru said: 'If Your Majesty has no one, I wish to carry the jade disk and go as envoy.' If cities enter Zhao, the jade disk stays in Qin; If cities do not enter, I beg to return the intact jade disk to Zhao.' The Zhao king thus sent Xiangru carrying the jade disk west into Qin.",

Xiangru arrived, told the Qin king: 'Since Qin Duke Mu, over twenty rulers, never had firm binding agreements.' I truly feared being deceived by Your Majesty and wronging Zhao, thus had someone carry the jade disk back, secretly it has reached Zhao.' Moreover Qin is strong and Zhao weak. If Your Majesty sends a single envoy to Zhao, Zhao will immediately carry the jade disk to come.' Now with Qin's strength to first cede fifteen commanderies to Zhao, how would Zhao dare keep the jade disk and offend Your Majesty?' I know deceiving Your Majesty's crime deserves execution. I beg to enter the boiling cauldron. May Your Majesty and the ministers carefully consider it.' The Qin king and ministers looked at each other and laughed. The attendants wished to drag Xiangru away. The Qin king thus said: 'Now killing Xiangru, ultimately cannot obtain the jade disk, and severs Qin-Zhao harmony. Better to treat him generously and let him return to Zhao. Would the Zhao king for one jade disk's sake deceive Qin?' Ultimately he received Xiangru in court, completed the rites and returned him.",

She enforced the law against them, killing nine of Lord Pingyuan's influential retainers. Lord Pingyuan angered, wished to kill She. She thus advised: 'You in Zhao are a noble lord. Now if your household violates and does not serve the public, then law diminished. Law diminished then state weak. State weak then feudal lords attack. Feudal lords attack means no Zhao. How can you have this wealth? With your nobility, serving the public according to law then superiors and inferiors equal. Superiors and inferiors equal then state strong. State strong then Zhao secure, and you noble relative—how slight compared to the world?' Lord Pingyuan considered him worthy, spoke of him to the king. The king used him to manage state revenues. State revenues greatly balanced, people rich and treasuries full.",
