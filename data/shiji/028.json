Guan Zhong said: 'In ancient times, those who performed the feng sacrifice on Mount Tai and the shan sacrifice on Mount Li numbered seventy-two houses, and I have recorded twelve of them. In ancient times, the Wu Huai clan performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Fu Xi performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Shen Nong performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Yan Di performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Huang Di performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Tingting; Zhuan Xu performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Di Ku performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Yao performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Shun performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Yu performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Kuaiji; Tang performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; King Cheng of Zhou performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Sheshou: all received the mandate before they could perform feng and shan.' Duke Huan said: 'I have attacked the Shan Rong in the north, passing through Gu Zhu; attacked Da Xia in the west, crossed the Flowing Sands, tied horses and hung carriages, ascended Mount Bei'er; attacked south to Zhaoling, ascended Mount Xiong'er to gaze upon the Yangtze and Han rivers. I have assembled chariots three times, assembled carriages six times, united the feudal lords nine times, corrected the realm once, and no feudal lord dares disobey me. How is this different from when the Three Dynasties received the mandate?' Therefore Guan Zhong, seeing that Duke Huan could not be persuaded with words, set forth practical reasons, saying: 'The ancient feng and shan sacrifices used millet from Xiang Shang, grain from Bei Li, which served as the abundance; between the Yangtze and Huai rivers, one thatched hut with three ridges, which served as the mat. The Eastern Sea brought forth the fish with united eyes, the Western Sea brought forth the birds with united wings, and then there were fifteen things that came without being summoned. Now phoenixes and unicorns do not come, auspicious grains do not grow, but thorns and brambles flourish, owls appear frequently, and yet you wish to perform feng and shan - is this not impossible?' Therefore Duke Huan stopped. That year, Duke Mu of Qin welcomed the Jin lord Yi Wu. Afterward he installed three Jin rulers and pacified their disorders. Duke Mu died in his thirty-ninth year.",

The fifth is the Yang Lord, sacrificing at Fu. The sixth is the Moon Lord, sacrificing at Mount Lai. All are north of Qi, bordering the Bohai Sea.

It is said that those who have reached them find immortals and medicines of immortality there. Their birds and beasts are all white, and palaces are made of gold and silver. Before arriving, they appear like clouds; when arriving, the three divine mountains sink below the water. When approaching them, the wind always blows them away, and in the end no one can reach them. Every ruler has been devoted to them. When Qin Shi Huang unified the realm and reached the sea, the magicians' words were too numerous to count. Shi Huang considered himself to have reached the sea but feared he might not reach the mountains, so he sent people carrying boys and girls into the sea to seek them. The ships met in the sea, all using wind as an excuse, saying they could not reach them but had glimpsed them. The next year, Shi Huang toured the sea again, reaching Langye, passing Mount Heng, returning from Shangdang. Three years later, he toured Mount Jie, examined the sea-going magicians, returned from Shang Commandery. Five years later, Shi Huang went south to Mount Xiang, then ascended Mount Kuaiji, toured along the sea, hoping to encounter the marvelous medicines of the three divine mountains in the sea.

Luan Da was a Qi palace attendant, formerly studied with General Wencheng, afterward became the alchemist for King Shang of Qi. The Marquis of Lecheng's sister was Queen Kang, had no sons. King Kang died, another consort's son was established as king. Queen Kang had lewd conduct, did not get along with the king, they endangered each other according to law. Queen Kang heard Wencheng had died, wished to flatter the emperor herself, sent Luan Da through the Marquis of Lecheng to seek audience and speak of techniques. The emperor had executed Wencheng, afterward regretted his early death, pitied his techniques were not exhausted, when he saw Luan Da, was greatly pleased. Da was tall and handsome, spoke many strategies, and dared make great claims without doubt. Da said: 'I constantly travel in the sea, see An Qi, Xianmen and others. But they consider me lowly, do not trust me. Also consider King Kang just a feudal lord, not worth giving techniques to. I frequently spoke to King Kang, King Kang also did not use me. My teacher said: 'Gold can be made, river breaches can be blocked, immortality medicine can be obtained, immortals can be summoned.' But I fear suffering Wencheng's fate, then all magicians will shut their mouths, who would dare speak of techniques!' The emperor said: 'Wencheng died from eating horse liver. If you can truly perfect his techniques, what would I begrudge!' Da said: 'My teacher does not seek people, people seek him. If Your Majesty truly wishes to summon him, then honor his envoy, let him have relatives, treat him with guest rituals, do not demean him, make each wear their trust seal, then can make him communicate with divine people. Divine people still might accept or not. Make his envoy honored, then he can be summoned.' Therefore the emperor tested small techniques, fighting chess pieces, the chess pieces fought each other.",

Now the year has abundant harvests not yet repaid, why did the ding emerge?' All officials said: 'Heard that formerly Tai Di raised one divine ding, one means unified, the end where heaven, earth, ten thousand things are tied. Huang Di made three precious dings, resembling heaven, earth, man. Yu collected nine provinces' metal, cast nine dings. All once cooked and offered to the Supreme Deity and ghosts and spirits.

Qing had bamboo slips book saying: 'Huang Di obtained precious ding at Wan Qu, asked Gui Yu Qu. Gui Yu Qu answered: 'Huang Di obtained precious ding divine strategy, this year Ji You new moon dawn winter solstice, obtained heaven's cycle, end and begin again.' Therefore Huang Di welcomed the sun and pushed the strategy, afterward led twenty years again new moon dawn winter solstice, altogether twenty pushes, three hundred eighty years, Huang Di became immortal and ascended to heaven.' Qing through Shou Zhong wished to memorialize it. Shou Zhong saw the book was not orthodox, suspected it false writing, apologized saying: 'Precious ding matter already decided, what more to do!' Qing through favored people memorialized it. The emperor was greatly pleased, summoned and questioned Qing. Answered: 'Received this book from Shen Gong, Shen Gong already died.' The emperor said: 'Who is Shen Gong?' Qing said: 'Shen Gong is a Qi man. Communicated with An Qisheng, received Huang Di's words, no book, only has this ding book. Says 'Han rise should again be like Huang Di's time'. Says 'Han sage will be in Gaozu's grandson and great-grandson. Precious ding emerges and communicates with spirits, perform feng and shan. Feng and shan seventy-two kings, only Huang Di could ascend Mount Tai for feng.' Shen Gong said: 'Han ruler also should ascend for feng, ascending for feng can become immortal and ascend to heaven. Huang Di's time had ten thousand feudal lords, divine spirits' feng dwellers seven thousand. Realm's famous mountains eight, three in barbarian Yi, five in central states. Central states' Mount Hua, Shou Mountain, Tai Shi, Mount Tai, Donglai, these five mountains Huang Di constantly toured, met with spirits. Huang Di fought and studied immortality. Worried the people were not following the way, then beheaded those who defied ghosts and spirits. Over a hundred years then could communicate with spirits. Huang Di performed suburban sacrifice to Supreme Deity at Yong, stayed three months. Gui Yu Qu was titled Great Hong, died buried at Yong, so Hong Tomb is it. Afterward Huang Di received ten thousand spirits at Bright Court. Bright Court is Ganquan. So-called Cold Gate is Valley Mouth. Huang Di gathered Shou Mountain copper, cast ding below Jing Mountain. Ding completed, dragon hung beard down welcoming Huang Di. Huang Di mounted, group ministers and rear palace followers who ascended seventy plus people, dragon then departed upward. Remaining small ministers could not ascend, all held dragon beard, dragon beard pulled out, fell, fell Huang Di's bow. People gazed up at Huang Di already ascended to heaven, embraced his bow and beard crying, so later generations named the place Ding Lake, his bow Wu Hao.' Therefore the emperor said: 'Alas! If I can truly be like Huang Di, I would view leaving wife and children like removing shoes.' He appointed Qing as gentleman, sent east to wait for spirits at Tai Shi.",
