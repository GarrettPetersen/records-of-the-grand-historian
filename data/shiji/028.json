I have heard that in ancient times, those who enjoyed virtue necessarily repaid merit, and wish to increase the sacrifices to the various spirits. The officials discussed increasing Yong's five altars by one road carriage each, with harnesses and coverings; the western altar and qi altar by one wooden carriage each, four wooden horses, with harnesses and coverings; the Yellow River, Jiao, Han River to add two pieces of jade each; and for the various sacrifices, each to broaden the altar grounds, adding jade, silk, sacrificial stands, and vessels according to rank.

The officials together with the Grand Historian and sacrificial official Kuan Shu discussed: 'Heaven and earth sacrificial animals have curled horns and chestnut shells. Now Your Majesty personally sacrifices to Hou Tu, Hou Tu should have five altars in a round hill in the marshes, each altar one yellow calf great sacrificial animals, after sacrifice completely bury them, and wear upper yellow for the following sacrifices.' Therefore the emperor went east, first established Hou Tu sacrifice at Fen Yin's Zhi Qiu, as Kuan Shu and others discussed. The emperor personally gazed and bowed, like the Supreme Deity ritual. After the ritual finished, the emperor went to Xingyang and returned. Passing Luoyang, he issued an edict: 'The Three Dynasties are distant, far off and difficult to preserve. Enfeoff thirty li of land to the Zhou descendants as Zhou Zi Nan Jun, to maintain their ancestral sacrifices.' This year, the emperor began touring the commanderies and counties, gradually approaching Mount Tai.",

The ding greatly differed from common dings, patterned and engraved without inscriptions, considered it strange, reported to officials. Officials told Hedong governor Sheng, Sheng reported it. The emperor sent envoys to verify the shaman obtained the ding without fraud, then sacrificed with rites, welcomed the ding to Ganquan, followed along, the emperor offered it. Arriving at Zhongshan, it was warm and sunny, there was yellow cloud cover. A muntjac passed, the emperor personally shot it, used it to sacrifice. Arriving at Chang'an, the dukes and ministers all discussed requesting to honor the precious ding. The emperor said: 'Recently the river overflowed, years had poor harvests, so I toured and sacrificed to Hou Tu, prayed for the people to grow grain. Now the year has abundant harvests not yet repaid, why did the ding emerge?' All officials said: 'Heard that formerly Tai Di raised one divine ding, one means unified, the end where heaven, earth, ten thousand things are tied. Huang Di made three precious dings, resembling heaven, earth, man. Yu collected nine provinces' metal, cast nine dings. All once cooked and offered to the Supreme Deity and ghosts and spirits. When sages encountered them they rose, dings moved to Xia and Shang. Zhou virtue declined, Song's altar perished, dings then sank and disappeared, hidden and unseen. The ode says 'From hall to foundation, from sheep to oxen; great dings and small cauldrons, not noisy not arrogant, how examine their good fortune.' Now ding arrives at Ganquan, bright and lustrous dragon transformations, receiving good fortune without bound. Meets at Zhongshan, yellow white clouds descend covering, like beasts as symbols, road bows multiplied arrows, gathered obtained below the altar, report sacrifice great enjoyment. Only those who receive the mandate and become emperors know its intention and match virtue. The ding should appear at ancestral temples, stored in imperial courts, to match bright responses.'

Qing had bamboo slips book saying: 'Huang Di obtained precious ding at Wan Qu, asked Gui Yu Qu. Gui Yu Qu answered: 'Huang Di obtained precious ding divine strategy, this year Ji You new moon dawn winter solstice, obtained heaven's cycle, end and begin again.' Therefore Huang Di welcomed the sun and pushed the strategy, afterward led twenty years again new moon dawn winter solstice, altogether twenty pushes, three hundred eighty years, Huang Di became immortal and ascended to heaven.' Qing through Shou Zhong wished to memorialize it. Shou Zhong saw the book was not orthodox, suspected it false writing, apologized saying: 'Precious ding matter already decided, what more to do!' Qing through favored people memorialized it. The emperor was greatly pleased, summoned and questioned Qing. Answered: 'Received this book from Shen Gong, Shen Gong already died.' The emperor said: 'Who is Shen Gong?' Qing said: 'Shen Gong is a Qi man. Communicated with An Qisheng, received Huang Di's words, no book, only has this ding book. Says 'Han rise should again be like Huang Di's time'. Says 'Han sage will be in Gaozu's grandson and great-grandson. Precious ding emerges and communicates with spirits, perform feng and shan. Feng and shan seventy-two kings, only Huang Di could ascend Mount Tai for feng.' Shen Gong said: 'Han ruler also should ascend for feng, ascending for feng can become immortal and ascend to heaven. Huang Di's time had ten thousand feudal lords, divine spirits' feng dwellers seven thousand. Realm's famous mountains eight, three in barbarian Yi, five in central states. Central states' Mount Hua, Shou Mountain, Tai Shi, Mount Tai, Donglai, these five mountains Huang Di constantly toured, met with spirits. Huang Di fought and studied immortality. Worried the people were not following the way, then beheaded those who defied ghosts and spirits. Over a hundred years then could communicate with spirits. Huang Di performed suburban sacrifice to Supreme Deity at Yong, stayed three months. Gui Yu Qu was titled Great Hong, died buried at Yong, so Hong Tomb is it. Afterward Huang Di received ten thousand spirits at Bright Court. Bright Court is Ganquan. So-called Cold Gate is Valley Mouth. Huang Di gathered Shou Mountain copper, cast ding below Jing Mountain.
