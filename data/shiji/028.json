In times of flourishing dynasties, the feng and shan sacrifices respond accordingly; in times of decline, they cease.

Rites and music were abandoned, the feudal lords acted wantonly, and King You was defeated by the Dog Rong, so the Zhou moved east to Luoyi. Duke Xiang of Qin attacked the Rong to save Zhou, and began to be ranked among the feudal lords. After Duke Xiang of Qin became a feudal lord, he resided in the western frontier. Considering himself the descendant of Shaohao's spirit, he built the Western Altar, sacrificing to the White Emperor, using a sorrel horse, yellow ox, and ram as offerings. Sixteen years later, Duke Wen of Qin hunted east between the Qian and Wei rivers, and divination showed it was auspicious to settle there. Duke Wen dreamed of a yellow serpent descending from heaven to earth, its mouth stopping at Fu Yan. Duke Wen asked Shi Dun, who said: 'This is an omen from the Supreme Deity. Your lordship should sacrifice to it.' Therefore he built the Fu Altar, using the three sacrificial animals to perform suburban sacrifices to the White Emperor.",

Guan Zhong said: 'In ancient times, those who performed the feng sacrifice on Mount Tai and the shan sacrifice on Mount Li numbered seventy-two houses, and I have recorded twelve of them. In ancient times, the Wu Huai clan performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Fu Xi performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Shen Nong performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Yan Di performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Huang Di performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Tingting; Zhuan Xu performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Di Ku performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Yao performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Shun performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; Yu performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Kuaiji; Tang performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Yunyun; King Cheng of Zhou performed feng on Mount Tai and shan on Sheshou: all received the mandate before they could perform feng and shan.' Duke Huan said: 'I have attacked the Shan Rong in the north, passing through Gu Zhu; attacked Da Xia in the west, crossed the Flowing Sands, tied horses and hung carriages, ascended Mount Bei'er; attacked south to Zhaoling, ascended Mount Xiong'er to gaze upon the Yangtze and Han rivers. I have assembled chariots three times, assembled carriages six times, united the feudal lords nine times, corrected the realm once, and no feudal lord dares disobey me. How is this different from when the Three Dynasties received the mandate?' Therefore Guan Zhong, seeing that Duke Huan could not be persuaded with words, set forth practical reasons, saying: 'The ancient feng and shan sacrifices used millet from Xiang Shang, grain from Bei Li, which served as the abundance; between the Yangtze and Huai rivers, one thatched hut with three ridges, which served as the mat. The Eastern Sea brought forth the fish with united eyes, the Western Sea brought forth the birds with united wings, and then there were fifteen things that came without being summoned. Now phoenixes and unicorns do not come, auspicious grains do not grow, but thorns and brambles flourish, owls appear frequently, and yet you wish to perform feng and shan - is this not impossible?' Therefore Duke Huan stopped. That year, Duke Mu of Qin welcomed the Jin lord Yi Wu. Afterward he installed three Jin rulers and pacified their disorders. Duke Mu died in his thirty-ninth year.",

Someone asked about the explanation of the di sacrifice, and Confucius said: 'I do not know. If one knew the explanation of the di sacrifice, it would be like seeing the whole realm in the palm of the hand.' The Poetry says: 'When Zhou was on the throne, King Wen received the mandate, but his administration did not reach Mount Tai.' King Wu conquered Yin in the second year, but the realm was not yet peaceful when he died. Only during King Cheng's time was Zhou virtue fully pervasive, and King Cheng's feng and shan was close to it. When later ministers took power, the Ji clan traveled to Mount Tai, and Confucius criticized them.",

At this time Chancellor Zhang Cang liked laws and calendars, believing Han was the beginning of water virtue, so the river breaking the golden dike was its omen. The year began in winter's tenth month, color was black outside and red inside, matching the virtue. Gongsun Chen's words were not correct. He dismissed him. Three years later, a yellow dragon appeared at Chengji. Emperor Wen then summoned Gongsun Chen, appointed him as a doctor, and with the various scholars drafted matters of changing the calendar and clothing colors. That summer, he issued an edict saying: 'Strange spiritual objects have appeared at Chengji, without harming the people, the year has good harvests. I pray at the suburban sacrifices to the Supreme Deity and various spirits, the ritual officials discuss, do not avoid laboring me.' All the officials said: 'In ancient times the Son of Heaven personally performed the summer suburban sacrifice, sacrificing to the Supreme Deity in the suburbs, hence called suburban.'

Later someone again submitted a memorial saying: 'In ancient times the Son of Heaven constantly used spring to release sacrifices, sacrificing to the Yellow Emperor used one owl broken mirror; the Dark Sheep used sheep to sacrifice; the Horse Walk used one blue stallion; Tai Yi, Ze Mountain Lord, Earth Chief used oxen; Wu Yi Lord used dried fish; Yin Yang messengers used one ox.'

The officials together with the Grand Historian and sacrificial official Kuan Shu discussed: 'Heaven and earth sacrificial animals have curled horns and chestnut shells. Now Your Majesty personally sacrifices to Hou Tu, Hou Tu should have five altars in a round hill in the marshes, each altar one yellow calf great sacrificial animals, after sacrifice completely bury them, and wear upper yellow for the following sacrifices.' Therefore the emperor went east, first established Hou Tu sacrifice at Fen Yin's Zhi Qiu, as Kuan Shu and others discussed. The emperor personally gazed and bowed, like the Supreme Deity ritual. After the ritual finished, the emperor went to Xingyang and returned. Passing Luoyang, he issued an edict: 'The Three Dynasties are distant, far off and difficult to preserve. Enfeoff thirty li of land to the Zhou descendants as Zhou Zi Nan Jun, to maintain their ancestral sacrifices.'

Arriving at Zhongshan, it was warm and sunny, there was yellow cloud cover. A muntjac passed, the emperor personally shot it, used it to sacrifice. Arriving at Chang'an, the dukes and ministers all discussed requesting to honor the precious ding. The emperor said: 'Recently the river overflowed, years had poor harvests, so I toured and sacrificed to Hou Tu, prayed for the people to grow grain. Now the year has abundant harvests not yet repaid, why did the ding emerge?' All officials said: 'Heard that formerly Tai Di raised one divine ding, one means unified, the end where heaven, earth, ten thousand things are tied. Huang Di made three precious dings, resembling heaven, earth, man. Yu collected nine provinces' metal, cast nine dings. All once cooked and offered to the Supreme Deity and ghosts and spirits. When sages encountered them they rose, dings moved to Xia and Shang. Zhou virtue declined, Song's altar perished, dings then sank and disappeared, hidden and unseen. The ode says 'From hall to foundation, from sheep to oxen; great dings and small cauldrons, not noisy not arrogant, how examine their good fortune.' Now ding arrives at Ganquan, bright and lustrous dragon transformations, receiving good fortune without bound. Meets at Zhongshan, yellow white clouds descend covering, like beasts as symbols, road bows multiplied arrows, gathered obtained below the altar, report sacrifice great enjoyment.

Qing had bamboo slips book saying: 'Huang Di obtained precious ding at Wan Qu, asked Gui Yu Qu. Gui Yu Qu answered: 'Huang Di obtained precious ding divine strategy, this year Ji You new moon dawn winter solstice, obtained heaven's cycle, end and begin again.' Therefore Huang Di welcomed the sun and pushed the strategy, afterward led twenty years again new moon dawn winter solstice, altogether twenty pushes, three hundred eighty years, Huang Di became immortal and ascended to heaven.' Qing through Shou Zhong wished to memorialize it. Shou Zhong saw the book was not orthodox, suspected it false writing, apologized saying: 'Precious ding matter already decided, what more to do!' Qing through favored people memorialized it. The emperor was greatly pleased, summoned and questioned Qing. Answered: 'Received this book from Shen Gong, Shen Gong already died.' The emperor said: 'Who is Shen Gong?' Qing said: 'Shen Gong is a Qi man. Communicated with An Qisheng, received Huang Di's words, no book, only has this ding book. Says 'Han rise should again be like Huang Di's time'. Says 'Han sage will be in Gaozu's grandson and great-grandson. Precious ding emerges and communicates with spirits, perform feng and shan. Feng and shan seventy-two kings, only Huang Di could ascend Mount Tai for feng.' Shen Gong said: 'Han ruler also should ascend for feng, ascending for feng can become immortal and ascend to heaven. Huang Di's time had ten thousand feudal lords, divine spirits' feng dwellers seven thousand. Realm's famous mountains eight, three in barbarian Yi, five in central states. Central states' Mount Hua, Shou Mountain, Tai Shi, Mount Tai, Donglai, these five mountains Huang Di constantly toured, met with spirits. Huang Di fought and studied immortality. Worried the people were not following the way, then beheaded those who defied ghosts and spirits. Over a hundred years then could communicate with spirits. Huang Di performed suburban sacrifice to Supreme Deity at Yong, stayed three months. Gui Yu Qu was titled Great Hong, died buried at Yong, so Hong Tomb is it. Afterward Huang Di received ten thousand spirits at Bright Court. Bright Court is Ganquan. So-called Cold Gate is Valley Mouth. Huang Di gathered Shou Mountain copper, cast ding below Jing Mountain. Ding completed, dragon hung beard down welcoming Huang Di. Huang Di mounted, group ministers and rear palace followers who ascended seventy plus people, dragon then departed upward. Remaining small ministers could not ascend, all held dragon beard, dragon beard pulled out, fell, fell Huang Di's bow. People gazed up at Huang Di already ascended to heaven, embraced his bow and beard crying, so later generations named the place Ding Lake, his bow Wu Hao.' Therefore the emperor said: 'Alas! If I can truly be like Huang Di, I would view leaving wife and children like removing shoes.' He appointed Qing as gentleman, sent east to wait for spirits at Tai Shi.",
