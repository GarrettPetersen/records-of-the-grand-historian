He became prime minister of Wei to serve Qin, hoping Wei would submit to Qin first so other lords would follow. The King of Wei refused to listen to Zhang Yi. The King of Qin was angry and attacked Wei's Quwo and Pingzhou. He secretly increased his support for Zhang Yi even more. Zhang Yi was ashamed and had nothing to show for his efforts. He remained in Wei four years until King Xiang of Wei died and King Ai ascended. Zhang Yi again persuaded King Ai, but he wouldn't listen. Zhang Yi secretly ordered Qin to attack Wei. Wei fought Qin and was defeated.",

The King of Chu said, 'Do you have an explanation?' Chen Zhen replied: 'Qin's reason for valuing Chu is because Chu has Qi as an ally.' 'Now closing borders and breaking with Qi leaves Chu isolated.' 'Why would Qin covet an isolated state and give it six hundred li of Shangyu land?' 'Zhang Yi will return to Qin and certainly betray Your Majesty—this cuts off Qi relations to the north and creates trouble with Qin to the west. The troops of both countries will certainly attack together.' 'A good plan for Your Majesty would be to secretly unite while openly breaking with Qi, sending someone to follow Zhang Yi.' 'If they give us the land, breaking with Qi is not too late;' 'If they don't give us the land, we maintain the secret alliance.' The King of Chu said, 'I wish you would shut your mouth and stop speaking, waiting for me to get the land.' He gave the prime minister's seal to Zhang Yi and richly bribed him. Chu then closed its borders and broke relations with Qi, sending one general to follow Zhang Yi.",

The King of Qin wanted to send him but couldn't bear to say it. Zhang Yi volunteered to go. King Hui said, 'The King of Chu is angry at your betrayal over Shangyu land—he will surely vent his anger on you.' Zhang Yi said, 'Qin is strong and Chu weak. I am close to Jin Shang, who serves Lady Zheng Xiu. Whatever she says is followed.' 'Moreover, I carry Your Majesty's credentials to Chu—how dare Chu execute me.' 'Even if they execute me and Qin gets Qianzhong, that would fulfill my greatest wish.' He went to Chu. The King of Chu imprisoned Zhang Yi and prepared to kill him. Jin Shang said to Zheng Xiu: 'Do you know how lowly you are to the king?' Zheng Xiu said, 'Why?' Jin Shang said: 'The King of Qin loves Zhang Yi greatly and doesn't want to send him. Now he offers six counties of Shangyong land to bribe Chu, and sends beautiful women as brides, with palace singers as attendants.' 'The King of Chu values the land and respects Qin—Qin women will certainly be honored while you, madam, will be cast aside.' 'Better to speak on his behalf to save him.' Zheng Xiu then day and night spoke to King Huai: 'Ministers each serve their own lord.' 'Now the land has not yet gone to Qin, yet Qin sends Zhang Yi, showing great respect for the king.' 'The king has shown no courtesy but wants to kill Zhang Yi—Qin will certainly be furious and attack Chu.' 'I beg you and my son to move to south of the Yangtze, lest we become Qin's fish and meat.'
