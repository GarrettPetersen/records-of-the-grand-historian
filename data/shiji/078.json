I fear Han and Wei use humble words to remove their troubles but actually wish to deceive the great kingdom. Why is this? Your Majesty has no deep favors toward Han and Wei for generations, but has accumulated resentments for generations. Fathers and sons, brothers of Han and Wei who have died at Qin's hands now reach ten generations. Their home states are ruined, their altars of soil and grain destroyed, ancestral temples demolished. Bellies ripped open, intestines severed, necks broken, jaws crushed, heads separated from bodies, corpses exposed in the wilds, skulls stiff and fallen, visible across the borders. Fathers and sons, old and young bound at the neck with hands tied, becoming groups of captives meeting on the roads. Ghosts and spirits grieve in isolation, with no blood sacrifices. The people cannot live, clans are scattered, those who have fled and become servants and concubines fill the seas within the four directions. Therefore Han and Wei not being destroyed is Qin's state concern. Now Your Majesty aids them in attacking Chu—is this not a mistake?",
