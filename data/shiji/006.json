The Taiyuan commandery west of the river was again changed to Ai's state. In the ninth year, a comet was seen, or it crossed the sky. They attacked Wei's Yuan and Puying. In the fourth month, the emperor lodged at Yong. On Jiyou day, the king was crowned and belted with a sword. Lord Changxin Ai made rebellion and it was discovered. He falsified the king's imperial seal and the queen mother's seal to send county troops, guard troops, official riders, Rongdi lords and nobles, and attendants. He intended to attack the Qinian palace and cause rebellion. The king knew it and ordered Chancellor Lord Changping and Lord Changwen to send troops to attack Ai. They fought at Xianyang and beheaded several hundred. All were bestowed nobility, and the eunuchs who were in the battle were also bestowed nobility one level. Ai and the others were defeated and fled. He immediately ordered throughout the state: whoever captures Ai alive will be granted one million cash; whoever kills him, five hundred thousand.

          "literal": "A great search was conducted and guests were expelled. Li Si presented a memorial persuading the king, and the expel guests command was stopped. Li Si therefore persuaded the Qin king, requesting to first take Han to frighten the other states. Thereupon he had Si go down to Han. The Han king was worried about it. With Han Fei he plotted to weaken Qin. The Daliang man Wei Liao came and persuaded the Qin king saying: 'With Qin's strength, the feudal lords are like rulers of commanderies and counties. I only fear that the feudal lords will ally together and suddenly strike unexpectedly. This is why Zhi Bo, Fu Cha, and King Min perished.' I wish Your Majesty not to love wealth and objects, but to bribe their powerful ministers to disrupt their plans. It will cost no more than three hundred thousand gold, and then the feudal lords can be exhausted.' The Qin king followed his plan. He saw Wei Liao with proud ceremony, and his clothes, food, and drink were the same as Liao's. Liao said: 'The Qin king as a person has a bee-like nose, long eyes, a determined bird-like breast, jackal voice, little kindness but a tiger-wolf heart. When in poverty he easily puts himself below others, but when he obtains his will he also lightly eats people.' I am in common clothes, yet when he sees me he often lowers himself below me.' Truly, if the Qin king obtains his will in the world, the world will all become captives.' One cannot travel with him for long.' He then fled away. The Qin king became aware and firmly stopped him. He made him the Wei of Qin state and finally used his strategies. And Li Si handled affairs.",

Therefore we raised troops and executed them, capturing their king. I considered it good, perhaps to cease weapons and armor.' The Zhao king had his chancellor Li Mu come to ally and covenant, therefore we returned their hostage son. But then they doubled the covenant and rebelled against our Taiyuan. Therefore we raised troops and executed them, getting their king. Zhao Gong Zi Jia then self-established as Dai king. Therefore we raised troops and struck to extinguish them. The Wei king initially agreed to submit and enter Qin, but then plotted with Han and Zhao to raid Qin. Qin's troops and officials executed them, then broke them. The Jing king offered west of Qingyang, but then rebelled against the agreement and struck our Nanguo commandery. Therefore we sent troops and executed them, got their king, and then pacified their Jing land. The Yan king was muddled and chaotic. His crown prince Dan secretly ordered Jing Ke to be a bandit. Our troops and officials executed them and extinguished their state. The Qi king used Hou Sheng's plan, cut off Qin envoys, and wished for rebellion. Our troops and officials executed them, captured their king, and pacified Qi land. I, with my tiny body, raised troops to execute violent chaos. Relying on the ancestral temple's spirit, the six kings all submitted to their crimes. The world is greatly settled.' Now if the name and title are not changed, there is no way to match our success and transmit it to later generations. Discuss the emperor title.' Chancellor Wan, Imperial Secretary Jie, Court Judge Si and others all said: 'Formerly the Five Emperors had territories of a thousand li. Beyond that were the hou fu and yi fu, where feudal lords either came to court or not, and the Son of Heaven could not control them. Now Your Majesty has raised righteous troops, executed remnant bandits, pacified and settled the world. Within the seas it is all commanderies and counties, laws and commands come from one unification. This has never existed since high antiquity, and the Five Emperors did not reach this. We ministers respectfully discussed with the scholars and said: 'In ancient times there was the Heaven Emperor, the Earth Emperor, and the Great Emperor. The Great Emperor is most noble.' We ministers, risking death, present the honored title: the king as 'Great Emperor'. Commands shall be called 'decrees', orders shall be called 'edicts', and the Son of Heaven shall call himself 'I'.' The king said: 'Remove 'great', attach 'emperor', adopt the high ancient 'emperor' position title, and be titled 'emperor.' The rest as discussed.' The decree said: 'Acceptable.' King Zhuang Xiang was retroactively honored as Great Supreme Emperor. The decree said: 'I have heard that in high antiquity there were titles but no posthumous names. In middle antiquity there were titles, and after death they used conduct as posthumous names. Like this, then sons would discuss fathers and ministers would discuss rulers. This is very meaningless. I will not take them. From now on, abolish the posthumous name method. I am the Beginning Emperor.

Court Judge Li Si discussed and said: 'The sons and younger brothers of the same surname whom Zhou Wen and Wu enfeoffed were very many. Then their connections became distant, and they attacked each other like enemies. The feudal lords executed and attacked each other mutually, and the Zhou Son of Heaven could not prohibit it. Now within the seas, relying on Your Majesty's divine spirit for one unification, it is all commanderies and counties. The various sons and merit ministers can be heavily rewarded and granted from public taxes. This is very sufficient and easy to control.

With this to clarify human affairs, unite father and son in contract. Holy wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness manifest and make white the principles and way. Eastward he strokes the eastern lands, to inspect the soldiers and scholars. Affairs already greatly finished, then he approached the sea. The emperor's merit encourages toil in fundamental affairs. Honor agriculture, eliminate trade, the qianshou are rich thereby. Under universal heaven, unite hearts and bow wills. Instruments and weapons have one measure, same writing and characters. What the sun and moon shine upon, what boats and carriages carry. All complete their fate, none do not obtain their intention. Respond to the time and move affairs, this is only the emperor. Aid and correct different customs, cross waters and measure the earth. Worry and pity the qianshou, morning and evening not slack. Remove doubts and establish laws, all know what to avoid. Fang bo divide their duties, various administrations manage easily. Raise and lower must be proper, none not as planned. The emperor's brightness oversees and inspects the four directions. Honor and base, noble and base, do not exceed their order and conduct. Langye does not tolerate, all strive for chastity and goodness. Fine and large exhaust their strength, none dare be lazy or neglect. Distant and near avoid concealment, specialized in striving for solemnity and dignity. Upright and straight, sincere and loyal, affairs have constancy. The emperor's virtue preserves and stabilizes the four extremes. Execute chaos and remove harm, raise benefit and bring fortune. Restrain affairs by time, various productions multiply. The qianshou are peaceful and tranquil, not using weapons or armor. The six relatives mutually protect, ultimately without bandits or robbers. Joyful and happy receiving teaching, completely know the laws and forms. Within the six directions, the emperor's soil. West ford the flowing sands, south exhaust the north doors. East has the Eastern Sea, north passes Great Xia. Where human tracks reach, none are not subjects. Merit covers the Five Emperors, favor reaches oxen and horses. None do not receive virtue, each peaceful in their dwelling.",

Pushe Zhou Qingchen advanced and praised, saying: 'In other times Qin's lands did not exceed a thousand li. Relying on Your Majesty's divine spirit and clear holiness, he pacified and settled within the seas, drove out the barbarian Yi. What the sun and moon shone upon, none did not submit and obey. He made the feudal lords into commanderies and counties. People each were peaceful and happy by themselves, without the troubles of warfare, transmitted to ten thousand generations. From high antiquity it did not reach Your Majesty's might and virtue.' The Beginning Emperor was pleased. Scholar Qi person Chun Yuyue advanced and said: 'I, your minister, have heard that the kings of Yin and Zhou lasted over a thousand years. They enfeoffed sons, younger brothers, and meritorious ministers, themselves making branch supports. Now Your Majesty possesses within the seas, yet sons and younger brothers are common men. Suddenly there are ministers like Tian Chang and the Six Ministers, without support or brush, how can they mutually save each other?' Affairs that do not take ancient as teacher yet are able to last long, are not what I have heard. Now Qingchen also flatters to the face to increase Your Majesty's errors. He is not a loyal minister.' The Beginning Emperor sent down their discussion. Chancellor Li Si said: 'The Five Emperors did not mutually repeat, the Three Dynasties did not mutually follow. Each governed with what was appropriate, not opposing and reversing each other. Time changed and was different. Now Your Majesty has created a great enterprise, established merit for ten thousand generations. This is certainly not what foolish scholars know. Moreover, Yue's words are matters of the Three Dynasties. What are they sufficient to model? In different times the feudal lords together contended, thickly recruiting wandering scholars. Now the world is already determined, laws and commands come out as one. When common people are at home they exert themselves in agriculture and labor, scholars study and learn the laws and commands to avoid prohibitions. Now the various scholars do not take the present as teacher but study the ancient, to oppose the current age, confusing and disordering the qianshou. Chancellor Minister Si, risking death, speaks: In ancient times the world was scattered and chaotic, none could unify it. Therefore the feudal lords together arose. Their words all spoke of ancient to harm the present, adorned empty words to disorder reality. People favored their private studies to oppose what superiors established. Now the emperor has united the world, distinguishes black and white and determines one honored. Private studies mutually go with illegal teachings. When people hear commands descend, they each discuss them with their studies. Entering, their hearts oppose; exiting, they discuss in alleys. They boast of their master as a name, take different things as high, lead the group below to make slander. Like this if not prohibited, then the ruler's power descends to the superiors, factions and alliances form below. Prohibiting it is convenient. I, your minister, request that court historians burn all records that are not of Qin. Those not in the charge of scholar officials: throughout the world, whoever dares hide poems, books, or the words of the hundred schools, shall completely go to the commandery governors and commandery lieutenants to mix and burn them. Whoever dares to discuss poems and books in pairs shall be abandoned in the market. Those who use ancient to oppose the present shall be clanned. Officials who see and know but do not report shall share the same crime. If the command descends thirty days and they do not burn, tattoo them as city morning. What shall not be removed: books of medicine, divination, planting trees. If they desire to study the laws and commands, take officials as teachers.' The decree said: 'Approved.'",

Then he planned and made a court palace in the Shanglin Park south of the Wei. He first made the front hall Epang, five hundred paces east to west, fifty zhang north to south. Above it can seat ten thousand people, below it can erect five zhang flags. He circled and galloped as a covered way, from below the hall straight to the southern mountain. He marked the southern mountain's summit as a que. He made a covered way, from Epang crossing the Wei, connecting to Xianyang, to imitate the heaven extreme covered way cutting the Han reaching Yingshi. The Epang Palace was not completed; When completed, he wished moreover to choose a good name and name it. He made the palace Epang, therefore the world called it the Epang Palace.

Zhang Han and others' army several retreats. They memorialed requesting additional aid. Yan, Zhao, Qi, Chu, Han, Wei all established as kings. From east of the pass, for the most part all rebelled against Qin officials and responded to the feudal lords. The feudal lords all led their multitudes facing west. Pei Gong as general with several ten thousand people had already slaughtered Wuguan. He had a person privately approach Gao. Gao feared the Second Generation would anger and execute, reaching his person. He then declined illness and did not have morning audiences. The Second Generation dreamed a white tiger bit his left trace horse and killed it. His heart was not happy. He strangely asked for dream interpretation. The diviner said: 'The Jing water makes an evil spirit.' The Second Generation then purified at Wangyi Palace, wished to sacrifice to the Jing, and sank four white horses. He had an envoy reproach Gao with robber and bandit matters. Gao feared, then secretly plotted with his son-in-law Xianyang magistrate Yan Le and his younger brother Zhao Cheng, saying: 'His Majesty does not listen to remonstrations. Now affairs are urgent. He wishes to return calamity to my clan. I wish to change and place His Majesty, moreover establish Prince Ying. Zi Ying is benevolent and frugal. The common people all carry his words.' He had the Palace Attendant Commander as inner response, deceived by making as if there were great robbers. He commanded Le to summon officials and dispatch soldiers, pursue and rob Le's mother and place her in Gao's residence. He dispatched Le as general with officials and soldiers over a thousand people to Wangyi Palace hall gate. They bound the guard commander and deputy, saying: 'Robbers entered here. Why did you not stop them?' The guard commander said: 'The surrounding huts have soldiers set very carefully. How did robbers dare enter the palace?' Le then beheaded the guard commander, straight led officials entered, advanced shooting. The gentlemen and eunuchs were greatly startled. Some fled, some resisted. Those who resisted then died. Those who died were several tens of people. The Palace Attendant Commander with Le together entered and shot at His Majesty's canopy and seat curtains. The Second Generation angered, summoned the attendants. The attendants were all panicked and disturbed, did not fight. Beside there was one eunuch who served and did not dare leave. The Second Generation entered the inner quarters and said to him: 'Why did you not early tell me? It has reached to this!' The eunuch said: 'I, your minister, did not dare speak, therefore obtained wholeness. If they had made me, your minister, speak early, all would already be executed. How would I have obtained until now?' Yan Le advanced and approached the Second Generation, reproached him saying: 'You are arrogant and unrestrained, execute and kill without way. The world together rebels against you. You should make a plan for yourself.' The Second Generation said: 'Can the chancellor be seen?' Le said: 'Not possible.' The Second Generation said: 'I wish to obtain one commandery as king.' Not permitted. He again said: 'Wish to be a ten thousand households marquis.' Not permitted. He said: 'Wish with wife and children to be qianshou, compare to the various princes.' Yan Le said: 'I, your minister, received command from the chancellor, to execute you for the world. Though you have many words, I do not dare report.' He waved his troops to advance. The Second Generation committed suicide.",

He said: 'Qin was formerly a kingdom. The Beginning Emperor ruled the world, therefore was called emperor. Now the six states again self-established. Qin land is increasingly small. To be emperor with an empty name is not possible. It is proper to be king as before. Convenient.' They established the Second Generation's elder brother's son, Prince Ying, as Qin king. They used qianshou to bury the Second Generation in the Yichun Park south of Du. They commanded Zi Ying to purify, should see in the temple, receive the king seal. He purified for five days. Zi Ying plotted with his two sons, saying: 'Chancellor Gao killed the Second Generation in Wangyi Palace. He feared the ministers would execute him. He then pretended with righteousness to establish me. I heard that Zhao Gao then agreed with Chu to extinguish the Qin clan residence and become king of Guanzhong. Now they make me purify and see the temple. This wishes to take advantage in the temple to kill me. I will claim illness and not go. The chancellor will certainly come himself. When he comes, then kill him.' Gao had a person invite Zi Ying several times. Zi Ying did not go. Gao indeed went himself, saying: 'Clan temple heavy matters. Why does the king not go?' Zi Ying then stabbed and killed Gao at the purification palace. He three-clanned Gao's family to display at Xianyang. Zi Ying was Qin king for forty-six days. Chu general Pei Gong broke the Qin army and entered Wuguan, then reached Bashang. He had a person agree on Zi Ying's surrender. Zi Ying immediately tied his neck with a cord, white horse and plain carriage, offered the emperor seal and talisman, surrendered at the roadside of Zhi. Pei Gong then entered Xianyang, sealed the palace chambers and treasuries storehouses, returned the army to Bashang. He resided more than a month. The feudal lords' troops arrived. Xiang Ji was the alliance leader. He killed Zi Ying and the Qin various princes and clan residence. He then slaughtered Xianyang, burned its palace chambers, captured its sons and daughters, collected its precious treasures and goods wealth. The feudal lords together divided them.

Thereupon east of the mountains was greatly disturbed, feudal lords together rose, heroes and outstanding ones mutually established. Qin made Zhang Han general for the east campaign. Zhang Han then with the three armies' multitudes demanded ransom outside, to plot against his superiors. The ministers' lack of trustworthiness can be seen from this. Zi Ying was established, then did not awake. Suppose Zi Ying had ordinary lord's materials, merely obtained middle assistants, though east of mountains was chaotic, Qin's land could be whole and had, the clan temple sacrifices should not have been extinguished.",

However those who dared not exhaust loyalty and oppose faults, Qin customs had many taboo prohibitions. Loyal words were not finished in the mouth when the body became executed and drowned. Therefore it made the world's scholars incline their ears and listen, stand with heavy feet, shut their mouths and not speak. Therefore the three lords lost the way, loyal ministers did not dare remonstrate, wise scholars did not dare plan. The world was already chaotic, evil was not heard above. How was this not sorrowful! Former kings knew that blocking and obstructing harmed the country. Therefore they established nobles, grand masters, and scholars to adorn laws and set punishments, and the world was governed. When they were strong, they prohibited violence and executed chaos, and the world submitted. When they were weak, the five hegemons campaigned and the feudal lords followed. When they were reduced, inner guarded and outer attached, and the altars of earth existed. Therefore when Qin prospered, numerous laws and strict punishments made the world shake; When it reached their decline, the common people resented and hoped, and within the seas rebelled.

Those who are cold benefit from coarse hemp, those who are hungry find bran husks sweet. The world's cries are the new lord's resources. This says labored people are easy to be benevolent with. Suppose the Second Generation had had ordinary lord conduct and employed the loyal and worthy. Minister and lord would be one heart worrying about within the seas' troubles. They would wear white silk and correct the former emperor's faults. Split land and divided people to enfeoff meritorious ministers' descendants. Built countries and established lords with rites for the world. Emptied prisons and freed punishments and executions. Removed confiscated properties and filthy crimes. Made each return to their villages. Opened granaries and scattered wealth and money to raise the isolated, alone, poor, and difficult scholars. Light taxes and few affairs to assist the common people's urgency. Simplified laws and reduced punishments to hold their later ones. Made all the world's people obtain self-renewal. Changed conduct and practiced. Each careful of their bodies. Filled the myriad people's hopes. And gave the world with might and virtue. The world would have gathered. Then within the four seas, all would be happy and each peacefully happy in their places, only fearing there was change. Though there were crafty and slippery people, none would have hearts separated from above. Then the not proper ministers would have no way to adorn their wisdom, and violent chaos evil would have stopped. The Second Generation did not practice this art, and was heavy with without way. He ruined clan temples with the people. Moreover began making the Efang Palace. Numerous punishments and strict executions. Officials' governance harsh and deep. Rewards and punishments not proper. Taxes and collections without measure. The world had many affairs. Officials were not able to record. Common people were poor and difficult, and the lord did not receive and care for them. Then evil and false together rose. Upper and lower mutually fled. Those falsely accused of crimes were many. Punishments and executions mutually seen on the road. And the world suffered it. From lords and nobles below to the common people, people cherished a self-danger heart. They personally dwelt in the reality of poor bitterness. All were not peaceful in their positions. Therefore they were easy to move. Therefore Chen She did not use Tang and Wu's worthiness, did not rely on dukes and marquises' honor. He raised arms at the great marsh and the world echoed and responded. Their people were dangerous. Therefore former kings saw the beginning and end changes, knew the existence and perishing mechanisms. Therefore the way of shepherding people was devoted to peace for them only. Though the world had contrary conduct ministers, there would certainly be no echoed and responded help. Therefore it is said 'peace people can practice righteousness with, and danger people are easy to do wrong with'. This is what is called. Noble as emperor, rich and had the world. The body did not escape punishments and killings. The governance was toppled and wrong. This was the Second Generation's fault.",
