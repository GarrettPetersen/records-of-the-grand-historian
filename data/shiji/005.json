King Xiao summoned him to manage the horses between the Qian and Wei rivers. The horses greatly multiplied. King Xiao wished to make him Da Luo's proper heir. Shen Hou's daughter became Da Luo's wife and gave birth to a son named Cheng as the proper heir. Shen Hou then spoke to King Xiao and said: 'Formerly my ancestor's Li Shan daughter became the wife of Rong Xuxuan and gave birth to Zhong Hao. Because of kinship, he returned to Zhou and guarded the western frontier. The western frontier was harmonious because of this. Now I again give my daughter to Da Luo as wife, and she gives birth to the proper son Cheng. With the double marriage between Shen and Luo, the western Rong all submit. This is why we serve the king. Your majesty should consider this.' Thus King Xiao said: 'Formerly Bo Yi managed livestock for Shun. The livestock greatly multiplied, so he was given land and granted the surname Ying. Now their descendants also multiply horses for me. I will divide land as a fief for them.' He enfeoffed him at Qin, had him continue the Ying clan sacrifices, and titled him Qin Ying. He also did not discard Shen Hou's daughter as Luo's proper wife, to harmonize with the western Rong.",

Zhuang Gong was established for forty-four years. He died. Crown prince Xiang Gong succeeded him. In Xiang Gong's first year, he gave his younger sister Mu Ying as wife to the king of Feng. In Xiang Gong's second year, the Rong surrounded Quanqiu. Shi Fu attacked them but was captured by the Rong people. After more than a year, Shi Fu returned again. In spring of the seventh year, King You of Zhou used Bao Si to depose the crown prince and establish Bao Si's son as the proper heir. He repeatedly deceived the feudal lords. The feudal lords rebelled against him. The western Rong Quanrong, together with Shen Hou, attacked Zhou and killed King You below Mount Li. But Duke Xiang of Qin led troops to save Zhou. He fought very hard and had merit. Zhou avoided the Quanrong difficulty and moved east to Luoyi. Xiang Gong escorted King Ping of Zhou with his troops. King Ping enfeoffed Xiang Gong as a feudal lord and granted him the lands west of Mount Qi. He said: 'The Rong are without the Way. They have invaded and seized my Qi and Feng lands. If Qin can attack and expel the Rong, then Qin will have their lands.' They made an oath and enfeoffed him with nobility. Xiang Gong thus began his state.

How do we know our own people haven't informed Zheng of our plans? Cannot.' Mu Gong said: 'You don't understand. I have already decided.'

Mu Gong heard and angrily said: 'I am sending troops and you obstruct and weep for my army. Why?' The two elders said: 'We do not dare obstruct your army. When the army goes, our sons go with it; We are old and fear we will not see each other again if they return late, so we weep.' The two elders withdrew and told their sons: 'Your army will be defeated, and it will be at the Xiao defile.' In spring of the thirty-third year, the Qin troops went east, passing through Jin territory and the north gate of Zhou. Zhou's royal grandson Man said: 'The Qin army has no ritual.

If people made it, it would also embitter the people.' Mu Gong was astonished and asked: 'China uses poetry, books, ritual, music, and laws to govern, yet there is still occasional chaos. Now the Rong and Yi have none of this. What do they govern with? Is it not difficult?' You Yu laughed and said: 'This is precisely why China is chaotic. Since the supreme sage Yellow Emperor created ritual, music, and laws, and led by example himself, he barely achieved a small measure of order. When it came to his later generations, they became increasingly arrogant and licentious. They blocked the authority of the laws and used them to demand and supervise from below. When the lower people became utterly exhausted, they resented and hoped for benevolence and righteousness from above. Ruler and subject mutually contended and resented each other, leading to usurpation and assassination, even to the extinction of clans. All of this is of this category. The Rong and Yi are not like this. The superiors contain pure virtue in treating their inferiors. The inferiors cherish loyalty and faith in serving their superiors. A state's government is like governing one body. They don't know how they govern - this is truly the governance of sages.' Thus Mu Gong withdrew and asked Inner Scribe Liao: 'I have heard that neighboring states having sages is the worry of enemy states. Now You Yu is worthy. He is my harm. What shall I do?' Inner Scribe Liao said: 'The Rong king dwells in remote seclusion and has not heard the sounds of China. Your majesty should try sending him female musicians to seize his will; make requests for You Yu to loosen the space between them; detain him and not send him back, to make him miss his deadline. The Rong king will find it strange and must suspect You Yu. When there is space between ruler and minister, then we can capture him. Moreover, the Rong king likes music and must neglect his governance.' Mu Gong said: 'Good.' Therefore he sat with You Yu on curved mats and ate by passing vessels. He asked about the terrain and troop dispositions and examined everything. Then he commanded Inner Scribe Liao to send sixteen female musicians to the Rong king. The Rong king received them and was pleased. He did not return for a whole year. Thus Qin then returned You Yu. You Yu admonished several times but was not listened to.
