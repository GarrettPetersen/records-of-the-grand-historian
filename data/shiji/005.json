The Zhou prince Tui loved cattle, and I approached him through raising cattle. When Tui was about to employ me, Jian Shu stopped me; I left and avoided being executed. When I served the ruler of Yu, Jian Shu stopped me. I knew the ruler of Yu would not employ me, but I was truly covetous of the salary and rank, so I stayed. Twice I followed his advice and escaped; once I did not follow it, and I was caught up in Yu's troubles. This is how I know he is worthy.' Duke Mu then sent someone with generous gifts to invite Jian Shu, and made him a Senior Grand Master.",

Moreover, if someone is selling out Zheng, how do we know that someone from our own state will not inform Zheng of our plans? This cannot be done.' Duke Mu said: 'You do not understand; I have already decided.' So he dispatched troops, sending Baili Xi's son Mengming Shi, Jian Shu's son Xi Qishu, and Bai Yibing to lead the army. On the day they departed, Baili Xi and Jian Shu wept for them. Duke Mu heard of this and angrily said: 'I dispatch troops and you weep to demoralize my army; why?' The two elders said: 'We would not dare to demoralize your army. The army marches, and our sons go with it; we are old, and fear we will not live to see their return, so we weep.' The two elders withdrew and said to their sons: 'When your army is defeated, it will certainly be at the Xiao Pass.'

In the fifteenth year, King Ping of Chu wanted to execute Jian, but Jian fled; Wu Zixu fled to Wu. The Jin ducal house was weak while the Six Ministers were powerful; they wanted to fight among themselves internally. This is why Qin and Jin did not attack each other for a long time. In the thirty-first year, King Helü of Wu and Wu Zixu attacked Chu. The king of Chu fled to Sui, and Wu then entered Ying. The Chu minister Shen Baoxu came to report the emergency. For seven days he did not eat, weeping day and night. Qin then dispatched five hundred chariots to rescue Chu and defeated the Wu army. The Wu army withdrew, and King Zhao of Chu was then able to return to Ying. Duke Ai reigned for thirty-six years and died. His heir apparent was Yi Gong.

In the eleventh year, the Grand Scribe Dan of Zhou had an audience with Duke Xian and said: 'Zhou was originally united with Qin and then separated; five hundred years after separation they will reunite, and seventeen years after reuniting a hegemon king will emerge.' In the sixteenth year, peach trees blossomed in winter. In the eighteenth year, it rained gold at Liyang. In the twenty-first year, he fought with Jin at Shimen, beheading sixty thousand. The Son of Heaven congratulated him with ceremonial robes. In the twenty-third year, he fought with Wei and Jin at Shaoliang and captured their general Gongsun Cuo. In the twenty-fourth year, Duke Xian died; his son Duke Xiao succeeded him, already twenty-one years old.",

          "text": "In the first year of King Wu, he met with King Hui of Wei at Linjin. He executed the Shu minister Zhuang. Zhang Yi and Wei Zhang both went east to Wei. He attacked Yiqu, Dan, and Li. In the second year, the office of Chancellor was first established; Hui Li Ji and Gan Mao became Left and Right Chancellors. Zhang Yi died in Wei. In the third year, he met with King Xiang of Han outside Linjin. Nan Gongjie died; Hui Li Ji became prime minister of Han. King Wu said to Gan Mao: 'I wish to open a road for chariots through Sanchuan, to look upon the Zhou royal house; then I could die without regret.' That autumn, he sent Gan Mao and the Senior Minister Shuchang Feng to attack Yiyang. In the fourth year, he captured Yiyang, beheading sixty thousand. He crossed the river and fortified Wusui. The heir apparent of Wei came to pay court. King Wu was strong and loved sport. The strongmen Ren Bi, Wu Huo, and Meng Shuo all rose to high office. The king competed with Meng Shuo in lifting a tripod and broke his kneecap. In the eighth month, King Wu died. Meng Shuo's entire clan was executed. King Wu had married a woman from Wei as queen, but had no sons. His half-brother of a different mother was established; this was King Zhaoxiang. King Zhaoxiang's mother was a Chu woman, surnamed Mi, known as Queen Dowager Xuan. When King Wu died, King Zhaoxiang was a hostage in Yan. The Yan people escorted him back, and he was established.",

The Senior Minister Shuchang Zhuang, along with senior ministers, feudal lords, and princes, rebelled. All were executed, and Queen Huiwen also did not die a natural death. King Wu's widow was sent back to Wei. In the third year, the king was capped. He met with the king of Chu at Huangji and gave Chu Shangyong. In the fourth year, he captured Puban. A comet appeared. In the fifth year, the king of Wei came to pay court at Yingting, and Puban was returned to Wei. In the sixth year, the Marquis of Shu, Hui, rebelled; Sima Cuo pacified Shu. The Senior Minister Shuchang Huan attacked Chu, beheading twenty thousand. Lord Jingyang was sent as hostage to Qi. There was a solar eclipse and daytime darkness. In the seventh year, he captured Xincheng. Hui Li Zi died. In the eighth year, he sent General Mi Rong to attack Chu and capture Xinshi. Qi sent Zhang Zi, Wei sent Gongsun Xi, and Han sent Bao Yuan to jointly attack Chu's Fangcheng and capture Tangmei. Zhao destroyed Zhongshan; its ruler fled and eventually died in Qi. Prince Jin of Wei and Prince Zhang of Han became feudal lords. In the ninth year, Mengchang Jun Xue Wen came to be prime minister of Qin. Huan attacked Chu, captured eight cities, and killed their general Jing Kuai. In the tenth year, King Huai of Chu came to Qin for an audience; Qin detained him. Xue Wen was dismissed because he accepted gold. Lou Huan became Chancellor. In the eleventh year, Qi, Han, Wei, Zhao, Song, and Zhongshan—five states—jointly attacked Qin, reaching Yanshi before returning. Qin gave Han and Wei territory north of the river and Fengling to make peace. A comet appeared. King Huai of Chu fled to Zhao; Zhao refused to receive him and he was returned to Qin, where he died. His body was sent back for burial. In the twelfth year, Lou Huan was dismissed; Marquis Rang Wei Ran became prime minister. Fifty thousand shi of grain was given to Chu.",
