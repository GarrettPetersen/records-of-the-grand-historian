Shen Hou then spoke to King Xiao saying: 'In ancient times, my ancestor from Li Mountain became the wife of Xuxuan the Rong, and gave birth to Zhongyan. Because of kinship ties, she returned to Zhou and protected the western border. The western border was harmonious because of this. Now I again married my daughter to Daliang, giving birth to the legitimate son Cheng. Shen and Liang have intermarried twice; the western Rong all submit. This is for the sake of the king.' Please consider this.' Therefore King Xiao said: 'In ancient times, Bai Yi raised livestock for Shun; the livestock greatly multiplied, therefore he received land and was granted the surname Ying. Now his descendants also breed horses for me; I will divide land as a fief.' He enfeoffed them at Qin, to continue the Ying clan sacrifices, titled Qin Ying. He also did not reject Shen Hou's daughter as Daliang's legitimate wife, to pacify the western Rong.",

He sent troops, had Bai Li Xi's son Meng Ming Shi, Jian Shu's son Xi Qi Shu, and Bai Yi Bing lead the troops. On the day of departure, Bai Li Xi and Jian Shu wept for them. Duke Mu heard and was angry, saying: 'I send troops and you cry to obstruct my army, why?' The two elders said: 'We do not dare obstruct your army. The army goes out and we cannot return, this is why we weep.' We are old, if we return late we fear we won't see each other again, that is why we weep.' The two elders withdrew and told their sons: 'Your army will certainly be defeated, at the Xiao defile.' Thirty-third year spring, Qin troops went east, passed through Jin territory, went by Zhou's north gate.

Between Huai and Si small states more than ten. Chu and Wei bordered Qin. Wei built the Great Wall, from Zheng north along the Luo, had Shang commandery. Chu from Hanzhong south had Ba and Qianzhong. The Zhou house was weak, the lords governed by force, contended to annex each other. Qin was remote in Yong province, did not participate in the alliances of the central states lords, treated as Rong and Di. Duke Xiao then spread benevolence, aided orphans and widows, recruited warriors, clarified merit rewards. Issued command in the state: 'In ancient times, our Duke Mu from between Qi and Yong, cultivated virtue and practiced military affairs, pacified Jin's disorders to the east with the Yellow River as boundary, became hegemon of the western Rong and Di, expanded territory a thousand li, the Son of Heaven granted hegemony, all lords congratulated, opened enterprises for later generations, extremely glorious and beautiful. Encountering in the past the unrest of Li, Zhao, Jian, and Chu Zi, the state had internal worries, no leisure for external affairs, the three Jin attacked and seized our former lord's Hexi lands, the lords belittled Qin, no shame greater than this. Duke Xian ascended, pacified the borders, moved the capital to Queyang, and wished to attack east, recover Duke Mu's former lands, follow Duke Mu's policies. I think of our former lord's intentions, constantly pained in my heart. Guests and ministers who can put forth extraordinary plans to strengthen Qin, I will honor with office and divide land with them.' Therefore sent troops east to besiege Xia city, west beheaded the Rong's Mi Wang.",
