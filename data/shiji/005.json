Zhuang Gong was established for forty-four years. He died. Crown prince Xiang Gong succeeded him. In Xiang Gong's first year, he gave his younger sister Mu Ying as wife to the king of Feng. In Xiang Gong's second year, the Rong surrounded Quanqiu. Shi Fu attacked them but was captured by the Rong people. After more than a year, Shi Fu returned again. In spring of the seventh year, King You of Zhou used Bao Si to depose the crown prince and establish Bao Si's son as the proper heir. He repeatedly deceived the feudal lords. The feudal lords rebelled against him. The western Rong Quanrong, together with Shen Hou, attacked Zhou and killed King You below Mount Li. But Duke Xiang of Qin led troops to save Zhou. He fought very hard and had merit. Zhou avoided the Quanrong difficulty and moved east to Luoyi. Xiang Gong escorted King Ping of Zhou with his troops. King Ping enfeoffed Xiang Gong as a feudal lord and granted him the lands west of Mount Qi. He said: 'The Rong are without the Way. They have invaded and seized my Qi and Feng lands. If Qin can attack and expel the Rong, then Qin will have their lands.' They made an oath and enfeoffed him with nobility. Xiang Gong thus began his state. He communicated with the feudal lords through envoys and marriage and hosting rites. He then used three liu colts, three yellow oxen, and three rams to sacrifice to Heaven at the western altar.

Having captured Baili Xi, he made him an attendant to Qin Mu Gong's lady. Baili Xi fled Qin and went to Wan. A Chu border person seized him. Mu Gong heard Baili Xi was worthy and wished to heavily ransom him. He feared the Chu people would not give him, so he had someone tell Chu: 'My attendant minister Baili Xi is there. Please ransom him with five black sheep skins.' . The Chu people then permitted and gave him. At this time, Baili Xi was already over seventy years old. Mu Gong released his prisoner and spoke with him about state affairs. He declined and said: 'I am a minister of a perished state. What am I worth asking!' Mu Gong said: 'The Yu ruler did not use you, therefore perished. It was not your crime.' He insisted on asking. They spoke for three days. Mu Gong was greatly pleased and granted him state government, titling him the Five Black Sheep Grand Master. Baili Xi declined and said: 'I am not equal to my friend Jianshu. Jianshu is worthy but the world does not know him. I often wandered destitute in Qi and begged food from the people of Zhi. Jianshu took me in. Therefore I wished to serve the Qi ruler Wu Zhi. Jianshu stopped me. I escaped the Qi disaster and went to Zhou. Prince Zi Sui of Zhou liked oxen. I sought him by raising oxen. When Zi Sui wished to use me, Jianshu stopped me. I left and escaped execution. I served the Yu ruler. Jianshu stopped me. I knew the Yu ruler would not use me. I truly stayed for private benefit of salary and rank. Twice I used his words and escaped. Once I did not use them and met with the Yu ruler's disaster. This is why I know his worthiness.' Thus Mu Gong sent someone with rich gifts to welcome Jianshu and made him an upper grand master.",

Thus the three hundred men who ate the good horses below Mount Qi galloped and braved the Jin army. The Jin army broke the siege. They freed Mu Gong and instead captured the Jin ruler alive. Initially, Mu Gong lost a good horse. Over three hundred wild men below Mount Qi together got it and ate it. Officials pursued and got them, wishing to punish them. Mu Gong said: 'A gentleman does not harm people with livestock. I have heard that eating good horse meat without drinking wine harms people.' He then granted wine to all and pardoned them. The three hundred men heard Qin was striking Jin. They all sought to follow. When they followed and saw Mu Gong in distress, they all pushed forward with spears and contended to die, to repay the virtue of the horse eating. Thus Mu Gong captured the Jin ruler and returned. He ordered in the state to prepare lodging. 'I will sacrifice the Jin ruler to Heaven.' The Zhou Son of Heaven heard it and said 'Jin is of my same surname.' He requested the Jin ruler. Yiwu's sister was also Mu Gong's lady. The lady heard it and put on mourning garments with hemp shoes barefoot, saying: 'My brothers cannot save each other. This disgraces the ruler's command.' Mu Gong said: 'I got the Jin ruler as merit. Now the Son of Heaven requests him. The lady worries about this.' He then allied with the Jin ruler and permitted returning him. He changed his lodging to an upper lodge and fed him seven sets of sacrificial animals. In the eleventh month, he returned the Jin ruler Yiwu. Yiwu offered his land west of the river and had Crown Prince Yu be a hostage in Qin. Qin married Yu to a clan daughter. At this time, Qin land extended east to the river.",

If people made it, it would also embitter the people.' Mu Gong was astonished and asked: 'China uses poetry, books, ritual, music, and laws to govern, yet there is still occasional chaos. Now the Rong and Yi have none of this. What do they govern with? Is it not difficult?' You Yu laughed and said: 'This is precisely why China is chaotic. Since the supreme sage Yellow Emperor created ritual, music, and laws, and led by example himself, he barely achieved a small measure of order. When it came to his later generations, they became increasingly arrogant and licentious. They blocked the authority of the laws and used them to demand and supervise from below. When the lower people became utterly exhausted, they resented and hoped for benevolence and righteousness from above. Ruler and subject mutually contended and resented each other, leading to usurpation and assassination, even to the extinction of clans. All of this is of this category. The Rong and Yi are not like this. The superiors contain pure virtue in treating their inferiors. The inferiors cherish loyalty and faith in serving their superiors. A state's government is like governing one body. They don't know how they govern - this is truly the governance of sages.' Thus Mu Gong withdrew and asked Inner Scribe Liao: 'I have heard that neighboring states having sages is the worry of enemy states. Now You Yu is worthy. He is my harm. What shall I do?' Inner Scribe Liao said: 'The Rong king dwells in remote seclusion and has not heard the sounds of China. Your majesty should try sending him female musicians to seize his will; make requests for You Yu to loosen the space between them; detain him and not send him back, to make him miss his deadline. The Rong king will find it strange and must suspect You Yu. When there is space between ruler and minister, then we can capture him. Moreover, the Rong king likes music and must neglect his governance.' Mu Gong said: 'Good.' Therefore he sat with You Yu on curved mats and ate by passing vessels. He asked about the terrain and troop dispositions and examined everything. Then he commanded Inner Scribe Liao to send sixteen female musicians to the Rong king. The Rong king received them and was pleased. He did not return for a whole year. Thus Qin then returned You Yu. You Yu admonished several times but was not listened to. Mu Gong again several times had people secretly intercept You Yu. You Yu then left and surrendered to Qin. Mu Gong treated him with guest rituals and asked about the form of attacking the Rong.",

Fearing execution, he fled to Jin with a thousand chariots and heavy baggage. Duke Ping of Jin said: 'Hou Zi is rich like this. Why would he destroy himself?' He replied: 'The Qin ruler has no way. I fear execution. I wish to wait for his later generations then return.' In the thirty-ninth year, King Ling of Chu was strong.

Between the Huai and Si there were over ten small states. Chu and Wei adjoined borders with Qin. Wei built the long wall, from Zheng along the Luo to the north, and had Shang commandery. Chu from Hanzhong south had Ba and Qianzhong. The Zhou house was weak. The feudal lords governed by force and contended to annex each other. Qin was remote in Yong province and did not participate in the assemblies and alliances of the central states' feudal lords. The Yi and Di treated it as such. Xiao Gong thus spread favors, aided orphans and widows, recruited warriors, and clarified merit and rewards. He issued an order in the state saying: 'Formerly our Mu Gong from between Qi and Yong cultivated virtue and practiced martial affairs. He pacified Jin chaos in the east with the river as boundary. He hegemoned the Rong and Di in the west and broadened the land by a thousand li. The Son of Heaven conferred the title of Bo. All the feudal lords congratulated him. He opened the enterprise for later generations. It was very glorious and beautiful. Encountering the unrest of the previous Li, Zao, Jian Gong, and Chu Zi, the state had internal worries and no leisure for external affairs. The three Jin attacked and seized our former rulers' land west of the river. The feudal lords belittled Qin. There was no greater shame. Xian Gong ascended the throne, pacified and stabilized the borders, moved the capital to Yueyang, and wished to attack east to recover Mu Gong's former land and repair Mu Gong's government orders. I think of the former rulers' intentions and am constantly pained in my heart.
