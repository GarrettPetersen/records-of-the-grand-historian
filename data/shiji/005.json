I will not dare enter the city unless I kill the Rong king.' He then would attack the Rong but yielded to his younger brother Xiang Gong. Xiang Gong became the crown prince. Zhuang Gong was established for forty-four years. He died. Crown prince Xiang Gong succeeded him. In Xiang Gong's first year, he gave his younger sister Mu Ying as wife to the king of Feng. In Xiang Gong's second year, the Rong surrounded Quanqiu. Shi Fu attacked them but was captured by the Rong people. After more than a year, Shi Fu returned again. In spring of the seventh year, King You of Zhou used Bao Si to depose the crown prince and establish Bao Si's son as the proper heir. He repeatedly deceived the feudal lords. The feudal lords rebelled against him. The western Rong Quanrong, together with Shen Hou, attacked Zhou and killed King You below Mount Li. But Duke Xiang of Qin led troops to save Zhou. He fought very hard and had merit. Zhou avoided the Quanrong difficulty and moved east to Luoyi. Xiang Gong escorted King Ping of Zhou with his troops. King Ping enfeoffed Xiang Gong as a feudal lord and granted him the lands west of Mount Qi. He said: 'The Rong are without the Way. They have invaded and seized my Qi and Feng lands. If Qin can attack and expel the Rong, then Qin will have their lands.' They made an oath and enfeoffed him with nobility. Xiang Gong thus began his state. He communicated with the feudal lords through envoys and marriage and hosting rites. He then used three liu colts, three yellow oxen, and three rams to sacrifice to Heaven at the western altar.

Mu Gong moreover treated him with great courtesy and generosity. In spring of the twenty-fourth year, Qin sent someone to inform the Jin ministers, wishing to install Chong'er.

How do we know our own people haven't informed Zheng of our plans? Cannot.' Mu Gong said: 'You don't understand. I have already decided.' He then sent troops, having Baili Xi's son Meng Mingshi, Jianshu's son Xi Qishu, and Bai Yibing lead the troops. On the day of departure, Baili Xi and Jianshu wept for them. Mu Gong heard and angrily said: 'I am sending troops and you obstruct and weep for my army. Why?' The two elders said: 'We do not dare obstruct your army. When the army goes, our sons go with it; We are old and fear we will not see each other again if they return late, so we weep.' The two elders withdrew and told their sons: 'Your army will be defeated, and it will be at the Xiao defile.' In spring of the thirty-third year, the Qin troops went east, passing through Jin territory and the north gate of Zhou. Zhou's royal grandson Man said: 'The Qin army has no ritual. What are they waiting for if not defeat!' The troops reached Hua. The Zheng merchant Xian Gao, holding twelve oxen to sell to Zhou, saw the Qin troops.

          "literal": "In Xiao Gong's first year, east of the rivers and mountains there were six strong states, equal to Qi Wei, Chu Xuan, Wei Hui, Yan Dao, Han Ai, and Zhao Cheng Hou. Between the Huai and Si there were over ten small states. Chu and Wei adjoined borders with Qin. Wei built the long wall, from Zheng along the Luo to the north, and had Shang commandery. Chu from Hanzhong south had Ba and Qianzhong. The Zhou house was weak. The feudal lords governed by force and contended to annex each other. Qin was remote in Yong province and did not participate in the assemblies and alliances of the central states' feudal lords. The Yi and Di treated it as such. Xiao Gong thus spread favors, aided orphans and widows, recruited warriors, and clarified merit and rewards. He issued an order in the state saying: 'Formerly our Mu Gong from between Qi and Yong cultivated virtue and practiced martial affairs. He pacified Jin chaos in the east with the river as boundary. He hegemoned the Rong and Di in the west and broadened the land by a thousand li. The Son of Heaven conferred the title of Bo. All the feudal lords congratulated him. He opened the enterprise for later generations. It was very glorious and beautiful. Encountering the unrest of the previous Li, Zao, Jian Gong, and Chu Zi, the state had internal worries and no leisure for external affairs. The three Jin attacked and seized our former rulers' land west of the river. The feudal lords belittled Qin. There was no greater shame. Xian Gong ascended the throne, pacified and stabilized the borders, moved the capital to Yueyang, and wished to attack east to recover Mu Gong's former land and repair Mu Gong's government orders. I think of the former rulers' intentions and am constantly pained in my heart. Any guest or minister who can produce extraordinary plans to strengthen Qin, I will moreover honor his office and divide land with him.' Thus he then sent troops to surround Xia city in the east and beheaded the Rong's Lian Wang in the west.",
