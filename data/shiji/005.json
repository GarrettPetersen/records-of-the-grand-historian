Nüxiu was weaving when a dark bird dropped an egg; Nüxiu swallowed it and gave birth to a son named Daye. Daye married the daughter of Shaodian, named Nühua. Nühua gave birth to Da Fei, who helped Yu control the floods. When this was accomplished, the emperor bestowed a black jade tablet. Yu accepted it saying: 'It was not my ability alone that accomplished this; Da Fei was my assistant.' Emperor Shun said: 'Ah, Fei, you aided Yu's achievements. I grant you a black banner. Your descendants will greatly multiply.' He married him to a jade maiden of the Yao clan. Da Fei bowed and accepted, assisted Shun in taming birds and beasts, and many birds and beasts became tame. This was Bai Yi. Shun granted the surname Ying.",

Duke Mu heard Baili Xi was worthy, wanted to ransom him with a high price, feared Chu would not give him, so sent someone to tell Chu: 'My concubine's servant Baili Xi is there, please ransom him with five black ram skins.' . Chu people then agreed to give him. At this time, Baili Xi was already over seventy years old. Duke Mu released him from prison, discussed state affairs with him. Declined saying: 'I am a minister of a ruined state, why ask me!' Duke Mu said: 'The Yu lord did not employ you, therefore perished; it was not your crime.' Insisted on asking, talked for three days, Duke Mu was greatly pleased, entrusted him with state administration, titled him Minister of Five Black Rams. Baili Xi declined saying: 'I am not as good as my friend Jian Shu. Jian Shu is worthy but the world does not know it. I once wandered destitute in Qi and begged for food from people of Zhi; Jian Shu took me in. I therefore wanted to serve Qi lord Wuzhi; Jian Shu stopped me, I escaped the Qi disaster, then went to Zhou. Zhou prince Dai loved cattle; I approached him by raising cattle. When Dai wanted to employ me, Jian Shu stopped me; I left, avoided execution. Serving the Yu lord, Jian Shu stopped me. I knew the Yu lord would not employ me; I truly sought personal profit in rank and salary, so stayed. Twice I followed his advice and escaped; once I did not follow, and encountered the Yu lord's disaster: this is how I know his worthiness.' Therefore Duke Mu sent people with generous gifts to welcome Jian Shu, made him Senior Minister.",

Now reneging on the Qin agreement and killing Li Ke, all are Lü Sheng and Xi Rui's plans.' I wish you would urgently summon Lü and Xi with benefits; when Lü and Xi arrive, then change and enter Chong'er instead.' Duke Mu agreed, sent someone with Pi Zheng to return, summoned Lü and Xi. Lü, Xi and others suspected Pi Zheng had secrets, so said Yi Wu killed Pi Zheng. Pi Zheng's son Pi Bao fled to Qin, persuaded Duke Mu saying: 'The Jin ruler is without the Way, the common people are not close to him, he can be attacked.'

Duke Mu sent troops, made Pi Bao general, personally went to attack them. In ninth month, Renchen day, fought a combined battle with Jin Hui Duke Yi Wu at Han territory. The Jin ruler abandoned his army, competed with Qin for advantage, retreated and his horse stumbled. Duke Mu with his subordinates galloped after him, could not catch the Jin ruler, instead was surrounded by Jin army. Jin attacked Duke Mu, Duke Mu was injured. Therefore the 300 men from under Qi Mountain who ate the fine horses charged through the Jin army, Jin army lifted the siege, thus rescued Duke Mu and instead captured the Jin ruler alive. Initially, Duke Mu lost fine horses, wild men under Qi Mountain together got and ate them, over 300 people; officials pursued and caught them, wanted to punish them by law. Duke Mu said: 'A gentleman does not harm people because of livestock. I have heard that eating fine horse meat without drinking wine harms people.' Then granted them all wine and pardoned them. Those 300 men heard Qin was attacking Jin, all requested to follow; following and seeing Duke Mu in distress, they all pushed forward their spears and fought to the death, to repay the grace of eating the horses. Therefore Duke Mu captured the Jin ruler and returned, ordered in the state: Fast and stay overnight, I will sacrifice the Jin ruler to the Supreme Deity. The Zhou Son of Heaven heard of it, said 'Jin is my same surname clan,' interceded for the Jin ruler. Yi Wu's sister was also Duke Mu's wife; the wife heard of it, wore mourning clothes barefoot, said: 'My brothers cannot rescue each other, bringing disgrace to your majesty's command.' Duke Mu said: 'I captured the Jin ruler as merit, now the Son of Heaven intercedes for him, this makes the wife worried.' Then made covenant with the Jin ruler, agreed to return him, changed to upper quarters, and fed him seven sacrificial animals. Eleventh month, returned Jin ruler Yi Wu; Yi Wu offered his territory west of the river, sent Crown Prince Yu as hostage in Qin. Qin married Yu to a daughter of the royal clan. At this time Qin territory reached east to the Yellow River.",

He sent troops, had Bai Li Xi's son Meng Ming Shi, Jian Shu's son Xi Qi Shu, and Bai Yi Bing lead the troops. On the day of departure, Bai Li Xi and Jian Shu wept for them. Duke Mu heard and was angry, saying: 'I send troops and you cry to obstruct my army, why?' The two elders said: 'We do not dare obstruct your army. The army goes out and we cannot return, this is why we weep.' We are old, if we return late we fear we won't see each other again, that is why we weep.' The two elders withdrew and told their sons: 'Your army will certainly be defeated, at the Xiao defile.' Thirty-third year spring, Qin troops went east, passed through Jin territory, went by Zhou's north gate. Zhou King Sun Man said: 'Qin army is discourteous, if not defeated, what are they waiting for!' The troops reached Hua, Zheng merchant Xian Gao, holding twelve oxen to sell in Zhou, saw Qin troops, feared being killed or captured, so offered his oxen, saying: 'I heard the great state will punish Zheng, the Zheng ruler carefully prepares defenses, sent me with twelve oxen to reward the soldiers.' The three Qin generals said to each other: 'We were going to attack Zheng by surprise, but Zheng now knows about it, going there is useless.' Destroyed Hua. Hua was Jin's border town.",

Duke Mu of Qin showed him palaces and storehouses. You Yu said: 'If ghosts made them, it would tire the spirits. If people made them, it would exhaust the people.' Duke Mu was surprised, asked: 'China uses poetry, books, ritual, music, and laws to govern, yet still has frequent disorder; now the Rong and Di have none of this, how do they govern, is it not difficult?' You Yu laughed, said: 'This is precisely why China is chaotic. Since the supreme sage Yellow Emperor created ritual, music, and laws, leading by example, barely achieved minor order. By later generations, daily becoming more arrogant and licentious. They rely on the majesty of laws to demand and supervise below; below exhausted to the extreme then use benevolence and righteousness to resent and look up at above; above and below contend in resentment and mutually usurp and assassinate, even to the point of destroying clans, all of this type. The Rong and Di are not like this. Above embraces pure virtue to treat below, below harbors loyalty and faith to serve above; a state's governance is like one body's order, not knowing how it is governed, this is truly the sage's governance.' Therefore Duke Mu withdrew and asked Interior Scribe Liao: 'I have heard that a neighboring state having a sage is an enemy state's worry. Now You Yu is worthy, my harm, what shall I do about it?' Interior Scribe Liao said: 'The Rong king lives in remote seclusion, has not heard China's sounds. Your majesty try sending him female musicians, to seize his will; make requests for You Yu, to widen the gap between them; keep him and don't send him back, to miss his deadline. The Rong king will find it strange, will certainly suspect You Yu. When ruler and minister have a rift, then they can be captured. Moreover the Rong king loves music, will certainly be remiss in governance.' Duke Mu said: 'Good.' Therefore sat with You Yu on curved mats, passed vessels and ate, questioned thoroughly about their terrain and military strength, and then ordered Interior Scribe Liao to send the Rong king sixteen female musicians. The Rong king received them and was delighted, stayed a whole year without returning. Therefore Qin then returned You Yu. You Yu repeatedly admonished but was not listened to, Duke Mu repeatedly sent people to intercept and urge You Yu, You Yu then left and defected to Qin. Duke Mu treated him with guest courtesy, questioned about the strategy for attacking the Rong.",

The Zhou house was weak, the lords governed by force, contended to annex each other. Qin was remote in Yong province, did not participate in the alliances of the central states lords, treated as Rong and Di. Duke Xiao then spread benevolence, aided orphans and widows, recruited warriors, clarified merit rewards. Issued command in the state: 'In ancient times, our Duke Mu from between Qi and Yong, cultivated virtue and practiced military affairs, pacified Jin's disorders to the east with the Yellow River as boundary, became hegemon of the western Rong and Di, expanded territory a thousand li, the Son of Heaven granted hegemony, all lords congratulated, opened enterprises for later generations, extremely glorious and beautiful.
