          "literal": "During Empress Gao's time, a man from Qi named Tian Sheng, traveling without funds, sought patronage from Marquis Yingling Ze with his paintings. Ze was greatly pleased with him and used 200 jin of gold to celebrate Tian Sheng's birthday. After Tian Sheng received the gold, he immediately returned to Qi. Two years later, Ze sent someone to tell Tian Sheng: 'The matter is finished.' Tian Sheng went to Chang'an but did not see Ze. Instead, he rented a large residence and had his son seek service with Zhang Ziqing, the Grand Usher favored by Empress Lü. After several months, Tian Sheng's son invited Zhang Qing to visit, preparing elaborate arrangements personally. Zhang Qing agreed to go. Tian Sheng prepared lavish curtains and furnishings, comparable to those of marquises. Zhang Qing was astonished. When the wine flowed freely, he dismissed the attendants and spoke confidentially to Zhang Qing: 'I have observed that the sons and younger brothers of the feudal kings in the various mansions number over a hundred, all of them Gaozu's founding meritorious officials. Now the Lü clan, being old acquaintances, originally helped push Gaozu to obtain the realm, their merit is extremely great, and moreover they have the weighty kinship of being the empress dowager's relatives. The empress dowager is advanced in years, the various Lü are weak, the empress dowager wishes to establish Lü Chan as king of Lü, ruling Dai. The empress dowager repeatedly brings this up, fearing the ministers will not listen. Now you are most favored, respected by the ministers—why not sound out the ministers to inform the empress dowager? The empress dowager will certainly be pleased. Once the various Lü are kings, a marquisate of ten thousand households will also be yours. The empress dowager desires this in her heart, and you as an inner minister, if you do not act quickly, disaster may befall you.' Zhang Qing greatly approved and began sounding out the ministers to speak to the empress dowager. At court, the empress dowager questioned the ministers. The ministers requested establishing Lü Chan as King of Lü. The empress dowager granted Zhang Qing a thousand jin of gold, and Zhang Qing gave half of it to Tian Sheng. Tian Sheng did not accept it, and instead advised him: 'Lü Chan is now king, but the various ministers are not yet greatly convinced. Now Marquis Yingling Ze, of the various Liu, serves as Grand General, and only he still feels disappointed. If you speak to the empress dowager now and have her enfeoff him as king of more than ten counties, he will obtain kingship, leave happily, and the various Lü kingships will be even more secure.' Zhang Qing went in and spoke, and the empress dowager agreed to it. Thus Marquis Yingling Liu Ze was made King of Langye. The King of Langye then went to his kingdom with Tian Sheng. Tian Sheng urged Ze to proceed quickly without delay. They passed through the passes, and the empress dowager indeed sent people to pursue and stop them, but they had already left, so they returned.",
