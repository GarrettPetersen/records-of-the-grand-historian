After King Sui of Zhao's rebellion was defeated, Pengzu ruled Guangchuan. In year 4, transferred to be King of Zhao. In year 15, Emperor Xiaojing passed away. Pengzu as a person was crafty, flattering, obsequious, outwardly respectful but inwardly deeply harsh. Loved law, used sophistry to entrap people. Pengzu had many favored consorts and descendants within. Chancellors and two thousand shi wishing to follow Han law to govern, would harm the king's household. Therefore whenever chancellors and two thousand shi arrived, Pengzu wore black cloth clothing, personally went to welcome them, cleared the two thousand shi residences, set up many doubtful matters to provoke and move them, obtained two thousand shi speaking wrongly, touching taboos, then recorded it. When two thousand shi wished to govern, then used this to coerce and threaten them; if not listened to, then submitted memorials to accuse, and defiled them with illicit profit matters. Pengzu reigned over 50 years, chancellors and two thousand shi none could complete two years, then left with crimes, major ones died, minor ones punished, therefore two thousand shi dared not govern. Yet King Zhao monopolized power, sent envoys to counties to act as merchants monopolizing markets, income more than the kingdom's regular taxes. Therefore King Zhao's household had much gold and money, yet what he granted to consorts and various sons also exhausted it. Pengzu took the Nao Ji whom King Jian of Jiangdu stole and had illicit relations with as consort, loved her greatly.",
