          "text": "Sun Tzu Wu was a Qi man. With military methods appeared before Wu King Helu. Helu said: 'Your thirteen chapters, I have completely viewed them, can make a small test restraining troops?' Answered: 'Acceptable.' Helu said: 'Can test with women?' Said: 'Acceptable.' Thus permitted it, took palace beauties, obtained one hundred eighty persons. Sun Tzu divided into two teams, with the king's favored consorts two as team leaders each, all commanded to hold halberds. Commanded them saying: 'You know your heart and left right hand back?' Women said: 'Know it.' Sun Tzu said: 'Forward, then look at heart; left, look at left hand; right, look at right hand; back, then look at back.' Women said: 'Yes.' Regulations having been issued, then set up axe and battle-axe, immediately three commands five declarations. Thus drummed right, women greatly laughed. Sun Tzu said: 'Regulations unclear, declared commands not familiar, general's crime.' Again three commands five declarations and drummed left, women again greatly laughed. Sun Tzu said: 'Regulations unclear, declared commands not familiar, general's crime; having already been clear yet not following method, officers and soldiers' crime.' Thus wished to behead left right team leaders. Wu king from platform observed, saw about to behead beloved consorts, greatly alarmed. Hastily sent envoy to issue command saying: 'I already know general can use troops. I without these two consorts, food not sweet, wish not to behead.' Sun Tzu said: 'Subject having already received command as general, general in army, lord's commands have some not accepted.' Thus beheaded two team leaders to show. Used their seconds as team leaders, thus again drummed. Women left right forward back kneel rise all hit compass square ink-line, none dared make sound. Thus Sun Tzu sent envoy to report king saying: 'Troops already orderly, king can try descend to observe, as king wishes to use them, though go to water fire still acceptable.' Wu king said: 'General rest return to quarters, I do not wish to descend observe.' Sun Tzu said: 'King merely likes its words, cannot use its reality.' Thus Helu knew Sun Tzu could use troops, ultimately made him general. West broke strong Chu, entered Ying, north awed Qi Jin, displayed name among feudal lords, Sun Tzu had strength therein.",
