In the state of Chu, the ruler is always chosen from among the younger sons. Moreover, Shang Chen has wasp-like eyes and the voice of a wolf - he is a cruel man and cannot be established.' The king did not listen and established him as crown prince. Later he again wished to establish Zi Zhi and demote Crown Prince Shang Chen. Shang Chen heard this but was not certain, so he told his tutor Pan Chong: 'How can I learn the truth?' Chong said: 'Feast the king's favored concubine Jiang Mi but do not show her respect.' Shang Chen followed this advice. Jiang Mi was angry and said: 'No wonder the king wishes to kill you and establish Zhi.' Shang Chen told Pan Chong: 'It is true.' Chong said: 'Can you serve him?'

          "text": "In the twenty-seventh year, spring, Wu attacked Chen, and Chu Zhao Wang rescued it, camping at Cheng Fu. In the tenth month, Zhao Wang fell ill in the army camp, with red clouds like birds flying alongside the sun. Zhao Wang asked Zhou's Grand Historian, who said: 'This bodes ill for the Chu king, but it can be transferred to the generals and ministers.' The generals and ministers heard this and requested to sacrifice themselves to the spirits. Zhao Wang said: 'Generals and ministers are my limbs - now transferring the calamity, how can I let them bear it!' He would not listen. They divined that the River was causing the trouble, and the grand masters requested to sacrifice to the River. Zhao Wang said: 'Since my ancestors received the enfeoffment, their domain did not extend beyond the Jiang and Han rivers, and the River is not something we have offended.' He stopped them and would not allow it. Confucius was in Chen and heard this, saying: 'Chu Zhao Wang understands the great Way. That he does not lose his state is fitting!'",

I wish to meet the king at Wu Guan, make a face-to-face agreement, form an alliance, and leave - this is my wish. I dare to inform your officials.' Chu Hui Wang saw Qin's letter and was troubled by it. He wanted to go but feared being deceived; if he did not go, he feared Qin would be angry. Zhao Sui said: 'Your Majesty should not go, but raise troops to defend yourself. Qin is like a tiger or wolf, cannot be trusted - they have intentions to swallow the feudal lords.' Hui Wang's son Zi Lan urged the king to go, saying: 'How can we break Qin's friendly intentions!' Therefore he went to meet Qin Zhao Wang. Zhao Wang deceitfully ordered a general to hide troops at Wu Guan, calling himself Qin Wang. When the Chu king arrived, they closed Wu Guan and escorted him west to Xian Yang, where he attended court at Zhang Tai like a vassal, without equal ritual. Chu Hui Wang was greatly angered and regretted not listening to Zhao Sui's words. Qin detained the Chu king and demanded the cession of the Wu and Qian Zhong commanderies. The Chu king wanted to form an alliance, but Qin wanted to get the land first. The Chu king angrily said: 'Qin has deceived me and now forcibly demands land from me!' He would not agree to Qin again. Qin therefore detained him.",
