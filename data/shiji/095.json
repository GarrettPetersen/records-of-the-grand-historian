This is recorded in the Hereditary House of Marquis Jiang Zhou Bo. When Xiang Yu rebelled against Chu, Han Xin from Huaiyin fled from Chu to join Han. The Han King appointed Han Xin as grain commissioner, but did not consider him exceptional. Han Xin often spoke with Xiao He, who recognized his talent. This continued until they reached Nanzheng. Xiao He had not finished speaking when Gaozu exclaimed in great surprise: My realm is small—how can it contain a man like Han Xin?
