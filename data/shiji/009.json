After the Empress Dowager is a hundred years old, I will certainly strike them.' The Empress Dowager was angered. Because of this she summoned King of Zhao. King of Zhao arrived. He was placed in the residence but not seen. Guards were ordered to surround and defend him. He was not given food. His ministers secretly fed him some. They were then captured and judged. King of Zhao was hungry. He then sang: 'The various Lü use affairs, the Liu clan is in danger. They coerce and threaten kings and marquises, strongly giving me a consort. My consort is already jealous, falsely accuses me of evil. The slanderous woman chaos the state, above never awakens. I have no loyal ministers. For what reason do they abandon the state? I will decide in the middle wilderness. Blue heaven raises the straight! Alas, it cannot be regretted. Rather early, make myself wealthy. As king and starve to death, who will pity it!

Now the Empress Dowager has died, the emperor is young, yet you wear the King of Zhao's seal and do not urgently go to your state to defend your fief but instead serve as supreme general commanding troops remaining here—this causes the great ministers and feudal lords to suspect. Why do you not return the seal and hand over troops to the Grand Commandant? Request the King of Liang to return the prime minister's seal, make an oath with the great ministers and go to your state; the Qi troops will certainly be dismissed, the great ministers will be at ease, and you will rest easy while ruling a thousand li—this is benefit for ten thousand generations.\" Lü Lu believed and agreed with this plan, wishing to return the general's seal and hand over troops to the Grand Commandant. He sent men to report to Lü Chan and the various Lü elders; some considered it convenient, some said inconvenient; the planning hesitated without decision. Lü Lu trusted Li Ji and from time to time went out hunting with him. He passed by his aunt Lü Xu; Xu was greatly enraged and said: \"You serve as general yet abandon the army; the Lü clan now has no place.\" She then brought out all pearls, jade, and precious vessels and scattered them below the hall, saying: \"Do not keep them for others.\"",

Empress Lü by stratagem deceitfully named other people's sons, killed their mothers, raised them in the rear palace, had Emperor Xiaohui claim them as sons, and installed them as heirs and as the various kings to strengthen the Lü clan. Now we have already exterminated all the various Lü, yet if we keep those who were installed and they grow up to handle affairs, we will have no posterity. It would be better to examine which of the kings is most worthy and install him.\" Some said: \"King Daohui of Qi was the High Emperor's eldest son; now his legitimate son is King of Qi; tracing it to the origin, he is the High Emperor's legitimate eldest grandson and can be installed.\" The great ministers all said: \"The Lü clan as external family were wicked and nearly endangered the ancestral temples, disordering the meritorious ministers; now the King of Qi's maternal family is Sijun—Sijun are wicked people. If we install the King of Qi, it will again become like the Lü clan.\" They wished to install the King of Huainan but considered him young and his maternal family also wicked. They then said: \"The King of Dai is presently the High Emperor's surviving son, the eldest, benevolent, filial, generous, and magnanimous. The Grand Empress's family, the Bo clan, are careful and good. Moreover, installing the eldest follows proper order; as he is known for benevolence and filial piety throughout all under Heaven, it is convenient.\" They then together secretly sent men to summon the King of Dai. The King of Dai sent men to decline and express thanks. After going back and forth twice, he then rode in six relay chariots. On the last day of the ninth month, the jiyou day, he reached Chang'an and lodged at the Dai residence. The great ministers all went to pay respects, presented the Son of Heaven's seal to the King of Dai, and together honored and installed him as Son of Heaven. The King of Dai declined several times; the assembled ministers firmly requested, and then he listened.",
