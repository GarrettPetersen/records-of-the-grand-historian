After the envoy went three times, Zhao Prime Minister Marquis of Jianping Zhou Chang said to the envoy: \"The High Emperor entrusted the King of Zhao to me; the King of Zhao is young. I have secretly heard the Empress Dowager resents Consort Qi and wishes to summon the King of Zhao to execute them together; I dare not send the king. Moreover, the king is also ill and cannot obey the edict.\" Empress Lü was greatly enraged and sent men to summon the Zhao Prime Minister. The Zhao Prime Minister was summoned to Chang'an, and she then sent men again to summon the King of Zhao. The king came but had not yet arrived. Emperor Xiaohui was compassionate and benevolent; knowing the Empress Dowager was angry, he personally welcomed the King of Zhao at Bashang, entered the palace with him, and personally stayed close to the King of Zhao in daily activities and meals. The Empress Dowager wished to kill him but could not find an opportunity. In the twelfth month of the first year of Emperor Xiaohui, the emperor went out at dawn to practice archery. The King of Zhao was young and could not rise early. The Empress Dowager heard he was alone and sent someone with poisoned wine for him to drink. At dawn, Emperor Xiaohui returned; the King of Zhao was already dead. Thereupon they moved King You of Huaiyang to be King of Zhao. In summer, an edict bestowed on the Marquis of Li's father the posthumous title Lingwu Marquis. The Empress Dowager then cut off Consort Qi's hands and feet, gouged out her eyes, seared her ears, made her drink a muting drug, had her reside in the privy, and named her 'Human Pig.' After several days, she summoned Emperor Xiaohui to observe the Human Pig. Emperor Xiaohui saw her, inquired, and then knew it was Consort Qi; he then wept loudly, consequently fell ill, and for over a year could not rise.

Emperor Xiaohui died; the Crown Prince was installed as Emperor. When the emperor grew up, someone told him his mother had died and he was not the true empress's son; he then spoke out, saying: \"How could the empress kill my mother and name me? I am not yet grown; when I am grown I will make changes.\" The Empress Dowager heard this and was troubled by it; fearing he would create disorder, she imprisoned him in the Eternal Coils, said the emperor was severely ill, and none of those around him could see him. The Empress Dowager said: \"Those who possess all under Heaven and govern as the fate of the ten thousand people should cover them like Heaven and contain them like Earth; above having a joyful heart to comfort the hundred clans, the hundred clans delighting to serve their superior, joy and delight flowing between them and all under Heaven governed. Now the emperor's illness has long not ceased; he has lost awareness and is confused and disordered, unable to continue succession to offer at the ancestral temples—all under Heaven cannot be entrusted to him; he should be replaced.\" The assembled ministers all kowtowed and said: \"The Empress Dowager on behalf of the common people of all under Heaven plans for the security of the ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain very deeply; the assembled ministers kowtow and receive the edict.\" The emperor was deposed; the Empress Dowager imprisoned and killed him. On the bingchen day of the fifth month, they installed King Yi of Changshan as Emperor and changed his name to Hong. They did not call it the first year because the Empress Dowager controlled the affairs of all under Heaven. They made Marquis of Zhi Zhao King of Changshan. They established the position of Grand Commandant; Marquis of Jiang Bo became Grand Commandant. In the eighth month of the fifth year, the King of Huaiyang died; they made his younger brother Marquis of Huguan Wu King of Huaiyang. In the tenth month of the sixth year, the Empress Dowager said King Jia of Lü was arrogant and self-indulgent in his residence and conduct and deposed him, making King Su Tai's younger brother Lü Chan King of Lü. In summer, they pardoned all under Heaven. They enfeoffed King Daohui of Qi's son Xingju as Marquis of Dongmou.",

Gentleman of the Palace Jia Shou, sent as envoy from Qi, came and enumerated Chan's faults, saying: \"If the king does not go to his state early, now even if you wish to go, can you still obtain it?\" He fully informed Chan that Guan Ying had formed a vertical alliance with Qi and Chu wishing to execute the various Lü, then urged Chan to urgently enter the palace. Marquis of Pingyang had somewhat heard his words and galloped to inform the prime minister and grand commandant. The Grand Commandant wished to enter the Northern Army but could not enter. Marquis of Xiangping Tong was in charge of tallies and tokens. They then had him hold the token and falsely admit the Grand Commandant into the Northern Army. The Grand Commandant again had Li Ji and Chief of Guests Liu Jie first persuade Lü Lu, saying: \"The emperor has sent the Grand Commandant to defend the Northern Army and wishes you to go to your state; urgently return the general's seal, take leave, and depart—if not, disaster will arise.\" Lü Lu believing Li as his elder brother would not deceive him then removed the seal, handed it over to the Chief of Guests, and handed over troops to the Grand Commandant. The Grand Commandant took command and entered the army gate, issued orders throughout the army, saying: \"Those for the Lü clan bare the right shoulder; those for the Liu clan bare the left shoulder.\" Throughout the army all bared the left shoulder for the Liu clan. The Grand Commandant traveled to his post; General Lü Lu had also already removed and handed over the supreme general's seal and departed; the Grand Commandant then commanded the Northern Army.",

Several men refused to lay down their weapons; Eunuch Commander Zhang Ze instructed and informed them, and they also laid down their weapons. Duke Teng then summoned the imperial chariot to carry the young emperor out. The young emperor said: \"Where do you wish to take me?\" Duke Teng said: \"Going out to your residence.\" They lodged him at the Junior Supervisor's. They then presented the Son of Heaven's ceremonial procession and welcomed the King of Dai at the residence. They reported: \"The palace has been carefully purged.\" The King of Dai that very evening entered Weiyang Palace. There were ten heralds holding halberds defending the端 Gate who said: \"The Son of Heaven is within—who are you and why do you enter?\" The King of Dai then addressed the Grand Commandant. The Grand Commandant went to instruct them; the ten heralds all laid down their weapons and departed. The King of Dai then entered and attended to government. By night, the officials divided into sections to execute and exterminate the kings of Liang, Huaiyang, and Changshan as well as the young emperor at their residences. The King of Dai was installed as Son of Heaven. After twenty-three years he died; his posthumous title was Emperor Xiaowen.",
