Shaogun was a person from the former Marquis of Shenze who came with the main methods. He concealed his age and where he grew up. He often claimed to be seventy, able to make things happen and dispel old age. His travels with methods reached everywhere among the feudal lords. He had no wife or children. People heard of his ability to make things happen and achieve immortality. They moreover fed and sent him gifts, often leaving surplus gold, money, silks, clothing, and food. People all considered that he did not manage estates yet had abundant supply, and moreover did not know where his income came from. They believed even more and contended to serve him. Shaogun was naturally good at methods and skilled at clever revelations that marveled and hit the mark. Once he followed the Marquis of Wuan drinking. In the seats there was an old man over ninety years. Shaogun then spoke of places where he had toured and shot with his grandfather. The old man, when he was a child, had followed his grandfather and gone there, and recognized those places. The entire gathering was astonished. Shaogun saw the emperor. The emperor had an old bronze vessel and asked Shaogun about it. Shaogun said: 'This vessel was displayed by Duke Huan of Qi in his tenth year at the Bo resting place.' Then they examined its inscriptions, and indeed it was a vessel of Duke Huan of Qi. The whole palace was startled, took Shaojun as a spirit, a several hundred years person also.",

You Shui Fagen then spoke and said: 'The Shang commandery has a witch. He was ill but a spirit descended upon him.' The emperor summoned and placed sacrifice at Ganquan. And when illness came, sent people to ask the spirit lord. The spirit lord spoke said: 'Son of Heaven, do not worry about illness. Illness slightly better, strong meet me at Ganquan.' Thereupon illness healed, then favored Ganquan, illness truly gone. He granted a great amnesty to the realm and established the Shou Palace for the divine lord. The divine lord's most noble was Taiyi. His assistants were called Great Prohibition, Controller of Fate, and such kinds. All followed him. He could not be seen, but his sound could be heard, equal to a person's speech. Sometimes he departed, sometimes he came. When he came, then the wind was solemn and calm. He resided in the room within the curtain. Sometimes he spoke in the daytime, but usually at night. The Son of Heaven performed purification, then entered. He used the witch as host, concerned with food and drink. What he desired, he spoke and it then descended. He moreover established the Shou Palace and North Palace, spread feather flags, set up offerings and utensils, to ritualize the divine lord. What the divine lord spoke, the emperor had someone receive and write down his words, naming it the 'painting method'. What he spoke of was what the world's customs knew, nothing extremely exceptional, yet the Son of Heaven alone was happy. His matters were secret; the world knew none of them.",

He formerly once studied with the same master as General Wencheng. Afterward he became King Jiaodong's favored artisan. Yet the Marquis of Lecheng's elder sister became Empress Kang, with no sons. King Kang died. Another consort's son was established as king. Yet Empress Kang had lewd conduct, did not get along with the king, and they mutually endangered each other with the law. Empress Kang heard that Wencheng had already died, yet wished to flatter herself to the emperor, so she sent Luan Da through Lecheng Hou to seek an audience and speak of methods. The Son of Heaven had already executed Wencheng. Afterward he regretted and resented his early death, cherished that his methods were not complete. When he saw Luan Da, he was greatly pleased. Da was a person tall and beautiful, spoke of many methods and strategies, yet dared to make big claims, and treated them without doubt. Da spoke and said: 'I once came and went in the sea, saw An Qi, Xian Men, and such kinds.' However, they considered me lowly and did not trust me. Moreover, they considered King Kang only a feudal lord, not worth giving methods to. I frequently spoke to King Kang, but King Kang moreover did not use me. Minister's teacher said: 'Yellow gold can be completed, yet river breach can be blocked, not die medicine can be obtained, immortals can be brought also.' Minister fears imitating Wencheng, then fangshi all cover mouth, how dare speak methods!' The emperor said: 'Wencheng ate horse liver and died only. You truly can repair their methods, I what would begrudge!' Da said: 'Minister's teacher does not seek people, people seek him. Your Majesty must want to bring them, then honor their envoys, command they have relatives, treat them with guest ritual, do not be lowly, make each wear their faith seal, then can make communicate words to spirit people. Do the spirit people still consent or not consent? Bring honor to their envoy, then they can be brought.' Thereupon the emperor had them first test small methods. The battle flags themselves mutually touched and attacked.",

He resided over a month and obtained four gold seals, wearing the seals of Heaven Knight General, Earth Soil General, Great Passage General, and Heaven Way General. Imperial edict to the Imperial Secretary: 'Formerly Yu dredged the nine rivers and breached the four channels. Recently the Yellow River has overflowed Gao Lu, and the dike corvee labor has not ceased. I have faced the realm for twenty-eight years. Heaven, if it bestowed me a knight, would greatly pass there. Qian is called 'flying dragon', 'great goose gradually at plate'. The intention is almost with it there. With two thousand households, enfeoff the Earth Knight General Da as Marquis of Le Tong.' He granted the marquises first-rank mansions and a thousand youths. The imperial carriage discarded chariots, horses, curtains, tents, and utensils to fill his home. He moreover married him to the eldest princess of Wei, carried ten thousand jin of gold, and changed the name of his city to Dangli Princess. The Son of Heaven personally went to the Five Profits residence. Envoys visited and inquired about what was supplied, connected and attached along the road. From the great princess and generals and chancellors below, all set up wine at his home and offered gifts to him. Thereupon the Son of Heaven moreover carved a jade seal called 'Heaven Way General'. He made the envoy wear feather clothes and stand on white cogongrass at night. The Five Profits General also wore feather clothes and stood on white cogongrass to receive the seal, to show he was not a minister. Yet the one wearing 'Heaven Way' moreover guided heaven spirits for the Son of Heaven. Thereupon Five Profits often sacrificed at night in his home, wishing to descend spirits. The spirit had not arrived yet, but the hundred ghosts had already gathered. However, he was rather able to make them. Afterward he prepared equipment and went, entered the sea to the east, seeking his master, it is said. Da appeared for several months, wore six seals, noble and shook the realm, yet between coastal Yan and Qi, none did not grasp and writhe while claiming they had forbidden methods and could divine immortals.",

She saw the ground in a hook shape, threw it down and inspected, obtaining a tripod. The tripod was greatly different from the crowd of tripods, with carved patterns but no inscriptions. She marveled at it and told the officials. The officials told the Grand Administrator of Hedong, Sheng, and Sheng reported it. The Son of Heaven had an envoy verify and question that the witch Jin obtained the tripod without illicit deceit. He then sacrificed with ritual, welcomed the tripod to Ganquan, followed the journey, and the emperor offered it. He arrived at Zhongshan. It was peaceful and warm, with yellow clouds covering it. A mi deer passed by. The emperor personally shot it and by means sacrificed to the cloud. He arrived at Chang'an. All the ministers, marquises, and grandees discussed and requested that the treasured tripod be honored. The Son of Heaven said: 'Recently the Yellow River overflowed, and for several years the harvests were not abundant. Therefore I toured and sacrificed to Houtu, praying for the commoners to grow grain. This year the abundant granaries have not had reports. Why would the tripod come out?' All the officials said: 'We have heard that formerly the Great Emperor raised a divine tripod one. One is unified - heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things are all tied to the end. The Yellow Emperor made three treasured tripods, symbolizing heaven, earth, and person. Yu collected gold from the nine regions, cast nine tripods, all once used to cook for the Supreme Deity and ghosts and spirits. When they encountered sages, they arose, moved to Xia and Shang. Zhou virtue declined, Song's altars perished, the tripod then sank and hid and was not seen. The ode says 'from hall to foundation, from sheep to ox; Nai tripods and gui, not unexpected not startled, how long-lasting happiness.' Now the tripod arrived at Ganquan, its light moist and dragon-like changed, receiving boundless blessing. United with this Zhongshan, yellow and white clouds descended and covered it, like beasts making talismans, road bows and carriage arrows gathered and obtained below the altar, reported the sacrifice with great feasting. Only those who receive the mandate and become emperors know its intention in their hearts and unite virtue there. The tripod should appear at the ancestral temples, be stored at the imperial court, to unite with the bright response.' The imperial edict said: 'Permitted.'",

Should establish Taiyi and the emperor personally suburban sacrifice to it.' The emperor doubted and was not decided. The Qi person Gongsun Qing said: 'This year we obtained the treasured tripod. Its winter solstice on the xinsi new moon dawn is equal to Yellow Emperor's time.' Qing had a bamboo book that said: 'The Yellow Emperor obtained the treasured tripod at Wan Qu and asked Guiyu Qu. Qu replied saying: 'The emperor obtained the treasured tripod and divine tally. This year's winter solstice on the jiyou new moon dawn obtained heaven's chronicle, ends yet repeats begins.' Thereupon the Yellow Emperor welcomed the sun and pushed the tally. Afterward, every twenty years he obtained the new moon dawn winter solstice. Altogether twenty pushes, three hundred eighty years. The Yellow Emperor ascended to heaven as an immortal.' Qing because of Suo Zhong wished to memorialize it. Suo Zhong saw his book was not orthodox, doubted it was a false book, declined and said: 'The treasured tripod matter is already decided. What more is there to do!' Qing memorialized it through a favorite person. The emperor was greatly pleased and summoned Qing to question him. He replied saying: 'Shen Gong received this book. Shen Gong is already dead.' The emperor said: 'What person is Shen Gong?' Qing said: 'Shen Gong is a Qi person. He communicated with An Qisheng and received the Yellow Emperor's words. There was no book, only this tripod book. It said 'When the Han rises again, it should be the Yellow Emperor's time. The Han sage is Gaozu's grandson and great grandson. The treasured tripod emerges and communicates with spirits, fengshan. Fengshan seventy two kings, only the Yellow Emperor was able to ascend Taishan for the seal.' Shen Gong said: 'The Han lord should also ascend and seal. If he ascends and seals, he will be able to ascend to heaven as an immortal.' In the Yellow Emperor's time there were ten thousand feudal lords, yet divine spirits' seals resided at seven thousand. The realm has eight famous mountains, three are among the barbarian yi, five are in the central states. In the central states: Huashan, Shoushan, Taishi, Taishan, Donglai. These five mountains were what the Yellow Emperor often toured, meeting with spirits. The Yellow Emperor moreover fought and moreover learned about immortals. He worried that commoners were not following his way, so he judged and executed those who were not ghosts and spirits. Over a hundred years later he was then able to communicate with spirits. The Yellow Emperor performed suburban sacrifices to the Supreme Deity at Yong, lodging for three months. Guiyu Qu was styled Great Hong. He died and was buried at Yong. Therefore the Hong tomb is it. Afterward it connected ten thousand spirits at the Yellow Emperor's bright court. The bright court is Ganquan. The so-called cold gate is the valley mouth. The Yellow Emperor collected copper from Shoushan and cast the tripod below Jing mountain. The tripod was already completed when a dragon hung its beard whiskers below and welcomed the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor mounted and rode. His ministers and harem followed, over seventy people ascended the dragon, and then went up. The remaining small ministers were not able to ascend, so they all held the dragon's whiskers. The dragon whiskers were pulled, dropping the Yellow Emperor's bow. The commoners gazed upward as the Yellow Emperor already ascended to heaven. They then embraced his bow and the dragon's beard whiskers and wailed. Therefore later generations named that place Ding Lake because of it, and his bow Wu Call.'' Thereupon the Son of Heaven said: 'Alas! If I could truly be like the Yellow Emperor, I would regard leaving my wife and children like removing shoes.' He then appointed Qing as a lang and sent him east to await spirits at Taishi.",

None knew its ritual etiquette. Yet the crowd of Confucians gathered fengshan Documents, Zhou officials, king systems' hope sacrifices and shoot ox matters. The Qi person Ding Gong, age over ninety, said: 'Feng is uniting the name of not dying. The Qin emperor was not able to ascend for feng. If your majesty must wish to ascend, gradually ascend and there will be no wind or rain, then ascend for feng.' The emperor thereupon ordered the various Confucians to practice shooting the ox and draft the fengshan ritual. Several years later, arrived and about to go. The Son of Heaven had already heard Gongsun Qing and the fangshi's words. From the Yellow Emperor above, fengshan all brought marvelous things and communicated with spirits. He wished to imitate the Yellow Emperor to taste connecting with divine immortal people Penglai scholars, high world compared virtue to the nine sovereigns, yet rather gathered Confucian arts to civilize it. The crowd of Confucians already because they could not debate and clarify fengshan matters, moreover were restrained by poetry books and ancient texts and did not dare to gallop. The emperor made feng sacrifice vessels and showed them to the crowd of Confucians. The crowd of Confucians some said 'not the same as ancient times'. Xu Yan moreover said 'The grand constant's various scholars performed ritual not as good as Lu'. Zhou Ba drew diagrams of feng matters. Thereupon the emperor demoted Yan and Ba, completely dismissed the various Confucians and did not use them.",
