Thus Bo Yi and Shu Qi heard that Western Lord Chang was good at supporting the elderly, why not go and attach to him. When they arrived, Western Lord died, King Wu carried the wooden spirit tablet, called him King Wen, east to attack Zhou.

The attendants wished to kill them with weapons. The Grand Duke said: 'These are righteous men.' Supported and sent them away. King Wu having pacified the Yin disorder, the world revered Zhou, yet Bo Yi and Shu Qi were ashamed of it, righteousness not to eat Zhou grain, hid on Shouyang Mountain, gathered ferns and ate them.
