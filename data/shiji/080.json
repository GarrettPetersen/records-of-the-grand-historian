South he defeated Chu prime minister Tang Mai at Chongqiu, west he crushed the three Jin at Guanjin, then allied with the three Jin to attack Qin, helped Zhao destroy Zhongshan, broke Song, expanding territory over a thousand li. He contended with Qin King Zhao to be emperor, but later abandoned it. The feudal lords all wished to turn from Qin and submit to Qi. King Min was arrogant. The people could not bear it. Thus Yan King Zhao inquired about attacking Qi. Yue Yi replied: 'Qi is the remaining enterprise of a hegemon state, with vast territory and large population—not easy to attack alone. If Your Majesty wishes to attack it, nothing better than allying with Zhao and Chu, Wei.' Thus he sent Yue Yi to make treaty with Zhao King Huiwen, separately sent envoys to connect with Chu and Wei, ordering Zhao to persuade Qin of the advantages of attacking Qi. The feudal lords hated Qi King Min's arrogance and tyranny, all competed to form alliance with Yan to attack Qi. Yue Yi returned and reported. Yan King Zhao mobilized all troops, making Yue Yi supreme general. Zhao King Huiwen granted Yue Yi the prime minister seal. Yue Yi thus combined and commanded the troops of Zhao, Chu, Han, Wei, Yan to attack Qi, defeating them west of Ji. The allied troops withdrew and returned, but Yan's army under Yue Yi alone pursued, reaching Linzi. Qi King Min's defeat west of Ji caused him to flee and defend Ju. Yue Yi alone remained to campaign in Qi. Qi all defended their cities. Yue Yi attacked and entered Linzi, taking all Qi's treasures, valuables, and sacrificial vessels, transporting them to Yan. Yan King Zhao was greatly pleased, personally came to Ji to reward the army, distribute rewards and feast the soldiers, enfeoffing Yue Yi at Changguo, titled Lord Changguo. Thus Yan King Zhao took the Qi captives and spoils back, while ordering Yue Yi to again use troops to pacify the Qi cities that had not surrendered.",
