South he defeated Chu prime minister Tang Mai at Chongqiu, west he crushed the three Jin at Guanjin, then allied with the three Jin to attack Qin, helped Zhao destroy Zhongshan, broke Song, expanding territory over a thousand li. He contended with Qin King Zhao to be emperor, but later abandoned it. The feudal lords all wished to turn from Qin and submit to Qi. King Min was arrogant. The people could not bear it. Thus Yan King Zhao inquired about attacking Qi. Yue Yi replied: 'Qi is the remaining enterprise of a hegemon state, with vast territory and large population—not easy to attack alone. If Your Majesty wishes to attack it, nothing better than allying with Zhao and Chu, Wei.' Thus he sent Yue Yi to make treaty with Zhao King Huiwen, separately sent envoys to connect with Chu and Wei, ordering Zhao to persuade Qin of the advantages of attacking Qi. The feudal lords hated Qi King Min's arrogance and tyranny, all competed to form alliance with Yan to attack Qi. Yue Yi returned and reported. Yan King Zhao mobilized all troops, making Yue Yi supreme general. Zhao King Huiwen granted Yue Yi the prime minister seal. Yue Yi thus combined and commanded the troops of Zhao, Chu, Han, Wei, Yan to attack Qi, defeating them west of Ji. The allied troops withdrew and returned, but Yan's army under Yue Yi alone pursued, reaching Linzi. Qi King Min's defeat west of Ji caused him to flee and defend Ju. Yue Yi alone remained to campaign in Qi. Qi all defended their cities. Yue Yi attacked and entered Linzi, taking all Qi's treasures, valuables, and sacrificial vessels, transporting them to Yan. Yan King Zhao was greatly pleased, personally came to Ji to reward the army, distribute rewards and feast the soldiers, enfeoffing Yue Yi at Changguo, titled Lord Changguo. Thus Yan King Zhao took the Qi captives and spoils back, while ordering Yue Yi to again use troops to pacify the Qi cities that had not surrendered.",

Upon ascending, Qi's Tian Dan heard of this and spread false rumors in Yan: 'The Qi cities not fallen are only two. Yet the reason they are not quickly taken is that Yue Yi has a rift with Yan's new king, wishing to join forces and remain in Qi, facing south to become king of Qi. What Qi fears most is another general coming.' Thus Yan King Hui was already suspicious of Yue Yi. Receiving Qi's false rumors, he sent Ji Jie to replace the general and summoned Yue Yi. Yue Yi knew Yan King Hui did not properly replace him, feared execution, thus surrendered west to Zhao. Zhao enfeoffed Yue Yi at Guanjin, titled Lord Wangzhu.

If Your Majesty wishes to attack it, must plan with the world. Planning with the world, nothing better than allying with Zhao. Moreover Huai north and Song territory are what Chu and Wei desire. If Zhao agrees and unites the four states to attack, Qi can be greatly broken.' The former king considered it correct, prepared tallies and credentials, sending me south as envoy to Zhao. Returning with the reply, raised troops to attack Qi. By heaven's way and the former king's spirit, the lands north of the Yellow River followed the former king and were raised at Ji. The army at Ji received command to attack Qi, greatly defeating the Qi people. Light troops and sharp soldiers drove straight to the capital. The Qi king fled to Ju, barely escaping with his life. Pearls, jade, treasures, carriages, armor, precious vessels—all entered Yan. Qi vessels displayed at Ning Terrace, great bells arrayed at Yuan Ying, ancient tripods returned to the stone chamber, Jizhou plants planted at Wen bamboo—from the Five Hegemons onward, none achieved merit matching the former king. The former king was satisfied in his ambitions, thus divided land to enfeoff him, allowing him to equal the small state feudal lords.
