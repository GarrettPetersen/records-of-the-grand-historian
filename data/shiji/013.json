Spirits and gods cannot complete themselves; they must be born through humans—how could they be born without fathers! One account says they had fathers, another says no fathers; believe what is believable, doubt what is doubtful, therefore both are stated. Yao knew Jie and Ji were both worthy men, born of Heaven, so he enfeoffed Jie with seventy li; after more than ten generations came Tang, who became king of the world. Yao knew Hou Ji's descendants would later become kings, so he additionally enfeoffed him with one hundred li; his descendants lasted nearly a thousand years, until King Wen obtained the world. The Odes tradition says: 'Tang's ancestor was Jie, born without a father. Jie's mother was bathing with her sisters at Xuanqiu Water when a swallow carried an egg and dropped it; Jie's mother got it, so she held it, mistakenly swallowed it, and thus gave birth to Jie. Jie was born and was worthy; Yao established him as Minister of Rites, and surnamed him the Zi clan. Zi means 'this'; 'this' means increasingly great. The poets praised and sang of it: 'The Yin altars are vast, Heaven's mandate, the dark bird descends and gives birth to Shang'. Shang means solid, Yin is the title. King Wen's ancestor was Hou Ji; Hou Ji was also born without a father. Hou Ji's mother was Jiang Yuan; she went out and saw the footprint of a great man, stepped in it, felt it in her body, and thus gave birth to Hou Ji. Jiang Yuan thought he had no father, considered him base, and abandoned him in the wilds; oxen and sheep avoided him and did not tread on him. She carried him to the mountains; the mountains nourished him. She also abandoned him in the great marsh; birds covered him with their wings and fed him. Jiang Yuan was astonished by this, so she knew he was a son of Heaven, and took him to raise. Yao knew his worthy talent and established him as Great Farmer, surnaming him the Ji clan. Ji means root. The poets praised and sang of it: 'In the beginning he gave birth to the people', deeply cultivating and increasingly completing, thus relating Hou Ji's beginning.'\" Confucius said: 'In ancient times Yao commanded Jie to be the Zi clan, because there would be Tang. He commanded Hou Ji to be the Ji clan, because there would be King Wen. King Tai commanded Ji Li to clarify the heavenly omens. Tai Bo went to Wu, thus establishing the source.' Heaven's mandate is difficult to speak of; only sages can perceive it. Shun, Yu, Jie, and Hou Ji were all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor grasped Heaven's mandate and governed the world; his virtue and favor ran deep to later generations, therefore his descendants all again became established as Sons of Heaven—this is Heaven's reward for the virtuous.
