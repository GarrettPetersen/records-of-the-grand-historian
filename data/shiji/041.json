Yue is still mourning their dead and has not recovered.' Wu did not listen and sent troops to attack Yue, suffering another defeat. Wu Zixu saw that the state could not be saved, so he gave his son to a fisherman and fled. The fisherman rowed him across the river, but Wu Zixu turned back and saw a fisherman pursuing him, so he drew his sword and said: 'The Wu king wants my head - you can take it and receive the reward.' He slit his own throat and died. The fisherman took his body and fled. Fu Chai returned and had the body exhumed, making a leather bag from Wu Zixu's skin. In the fourteenth year, Yue destroyed Wu. King Fu Chai of Wu said to his attendants: 'I regret not listening to Wu Zixu's words!' He covered his face and died. Yue took Fu Chai as a prisoner. Goujian wanted to live with Fu Chai in Yue, but Fan Li wrote to advise him: 'Fly a bird until its feathers are complete, then shoot it; catch a rabbit, then release the dogs. A defeated army can be revived, a destroyed state can be restored. The enemy of an enemy is a friend.' Goujian did not listen and kept Fu Chai. Later, Yue moved its capital to Lang Ye, and Goujian toured the Wu region, proclaiming: 'This was the territory of Fu Chai.' He had Fu Chai pull his chariot, saying: 'You are Fu Chai?' Fu Chai said: 'Yes.' Goujian said: 'I made you a servant - can you still be king?' Fu Chai said: 'Cannot.' Goujian pardoned him and gave him a house at Shi Men. Later, Fu Chai asked permission to see Goujian.",

After five generations, Yue was destroyed by Chu. The Yue people said: 'The mountains and rivers are the same, but the people have changed.' Therefore they sang: 'The mountains do not move, the rivers do not flow, but the people change their ways.' Moreover, has Your Majesty risen early and retired late not for Wu's sake? We plotted for twenty-two years, and now abandon it in a day - can this be done? Moreover, Heaven gives and one does not take - instead one receives the blame. 'Those who cut firewood follow the pattern that is not far' - have you forgotten the shame of Kuaiji?' Goujian said: 'I want to listen to your words, but I cannot bear to see the envoy harmed.' Fan Li then urged the advance of troops, saying: 'The king has entrusted government to you officials. Let the envoy leave, otherwise he will be guilty.' The Wu envoy wept and left. Goujian pitied him and sent someone to tell the Wu king: 'I will place you in Yong Dong, with a hundred families to serve you.' The Wu king declined, saying: 'I am old and cannot serve Your Majesty!'

During King Wei of Chu's time, Yue attacked Qi in the north. King Wei of Qi sent someone to persuade the Yue king: 'If Yue does not attack Chu, it cannot become a great king or even a small hegemon. I suspect Yue's reason for not attacking Chu is that it cannot obtain Jin's support. Han and Wei certainly will not attack Chu. If Han attacks Chu and overturns their army, kills their general, then Ye and Yang Di will be in danger; if Wei also overturns their army and kills their general, then Chen and Shang Cai will be uneasy. Therefore the two Jin states serving Yue would not go so far as to overturn armies and kill generals, nor would they expend their horses' sweat effectively. What is the importance of obtaining Jin's support?' The Yue king said: 'What I seek from Jin is not to the point of clashing blades and meeting in battle, much less attacking cities and besieging towns. I wish Wei would gather forces below Da Liang, and I wish Qi would test its troops in the southern regions of Ju territory, gathering at the borders of Chang and Tan.

If they do not do this, but clash blades between the rivers and mountains to serve Qi and Qin, then what they wait for is such a miscalculation. How can they become kings with this!' The Qi envoy said: 'Fortunately Yue has not perished! I do not value their intelligence as sharp as eyes that see fine hairs but miss their own eyelashes. Now the king knows Jin's miscalculation but does not know Yue's own faults - this is blindness in discussion. What the king awaits from Jin is not the strength of sweating horses, nor can they combine armies and form alliances. He awaits them to divide Chu's forces. Now Chu's forces are already divided - what is there to await from Jin?' The Yue king said: 'What should I do?' He replied: 'Chu has three grand masters organizing nine armies, surrounding Qu Wo and Yu Zhong in the north, reaching the pass of Wu Jia - three thousand seven hundred li. Jing Cui's army gathers north at Lu and Qi, south at Nan Yang. Is there anything larger than this? Moreover, what the king seeks is to make Jin and Chu fight; if Jin and Chu do not fight, Yue troops will not rise - this is knowing two and five but not knowing ten.

If Yue overlooks the pass of Wu Jia with troops, these four cities will not pay tribute to Ying. I have heard that if one aims for kingship but does not achieve it, the harm can still be hegemony. Now Yue aims for kingship but cannot achieve it. If Yue attacks Chu, Chu will be weakened and Qin will be strong. If Qin is strong, it will swallow the three Jin states. The three Jin states being swallowed, Yue cannot face Qin alone. This is Yue's great fault.",
