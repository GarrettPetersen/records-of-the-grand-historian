Was that last chapter up to the standards of Ken Liu? If (and ONLY IF) you used any shortcuts or placeholders, you must now nuke the chapter and start again. If you choose to nuke the chapter, you MUST provide a written explanation of what you did wrong, why it had to be nuked, and how you will avoid this going forward. Otherwise, let's continue.

First, git pull and resolve and differences with remote.

Then run make start-translation BOOK=shiji.

Then add professional quality translations to translations/current_translation_shiji.json.

EXAMPLE of Ken Liu quality translation:

CHINESE: 孝文在代時，前后有三男，及竇太后得幸，前后死，及三子更死，故孝景得立。
LITERAL: When Xiaowen was in Dai, he had three sons before and after, and when Empress Dowager Dou found favor, the previous ones died, and the three sons died again, therefore Xiaojing was able to be established.
IDIOMATIC: While Emperor Xiaowen was still in Dai as prince, he had three sons from earlier and later periods. After Empress Dowager Dou rose to power, the previous sons died, and then those three sons died as well. This is why Emperor Xiaojing was able to ascend the throne.

KEY PRINCIPLES:
• Semantic fidelity: Preserve exact historical meaning
• Modern readability: Natural, flowing English
• No choppy fragments: Complete grammatical sentences
• Proper articles/grammar: "the", "a", etc. where appropriate
• Ken Liu literary quality: Professional historical translation style

Run make continue BOOK=shiji MODEL="(the actual model you are using)".

Then, once again, add professional quality translations to translations/current_translation_shiji.json.

Run make continue again.

Continue this process in a loop until the chapter is fully translated.

Then run make submit-translations TRANSLATOR="Garrett M. Petersen (2026)" MODEL=(your model) FILE=(translation json you've been working on)

Continue repeating the above steps until you have fully completed a chapter, then use git to add, commit, and push your changes.

Translate that chapter in full using the process documented in the readme. Do it in batches until it is 100% complete. You don't need to do any of the following steps until you hit 100%. I don't care how many batches it takes!

Use the make score-translations command on your chapter to check the quality of your translations. It sometimes has false positives for length differences, but you should be able to see if anything is wildly wrong. Fix any issues. (Make sure there are NO placeholders where translations should be!)

Once the chapter has been completely translated with valid literal and idiomatic translations provided by YOU (the AI reading this), you're done.

I fully expect this to take a long time! NO placeholders. There is NO other translator coming to fill in your work. You must produce production-quality work without shortcuts.

Then run make update, and then push to github with an appropriate commit message, resolving any differences with remote.
