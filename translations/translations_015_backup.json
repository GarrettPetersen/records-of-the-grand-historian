{
  "s0001": "When Sima Qian read the Qin records, reaching the point where the Quanrong defeated King You and Zhou moved east to Luoyi, Qin Duke Xiang was first enfeoffed as a feudal lord, establishing the Western Altar to serve the Supreme Deity, the signs of presumption were already apparent.",
  "s0002": "The Rites say: \"The Son of Heaven sacrifices to Heaven and Earth; feudal lords sacrifice to the famous mountains and great rivers within their domains.\"",
  "s0003": "Now Qin mixed the customs of the Rong and Di barbarians, first tyrannical and cruel, later benevolent and righteous. Though positioned as a vassal minister, they arrogated the suburban sacrifices. Gentlemen fear this.",
  "s0004": "When Duke Wen crossed the Long mountains, drove out the Yi and Di barbarians, honored Chen Bao, and built fortifications between Qi and Yong, Duke Mu implemented good government, and his eastern border reached the Yellow River. He was then equal to Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin, the lords and hegemons of China.",
  "s0005": "After this, subordinate ministers took power, grand masters held hereditary stipends, the six ministers monopolized Jin's authority, conducting campaigns and alliances, their might heavier than the feudal lords.",
  "s0006": "When Tian Chang killed Duke Jian and became chancellor of Qi, the feudal lords calmly did not punish him. Within the seas, they contended over military achievements.",
  "s0007": "The three families finally divided Jin, and Tian He also extinguished Qi and possessed it. The flourishing of the six states began from this.",
  "s0008": "They devoted themselves to strengthening armies and annexing enemies. Plots and deceit were employed, and the theories of horizontal and vertical alliances arose.",
  "s0009": "They falsely claimed to swarm out like bees, their sworn alliances were untrustworthy. Even placing hostages and splitting tallies could not bind them.",
  "s0010": "Qin began as a small country in a remote place, the various Xia treated it as a guest, comparing it to the Rong and Di, but after Duke Xian it constantly dominated the feudal lords.",
  "s0011": "If we discuss Qin's virtue and righteousness, it was not as good as the tyranny of Lu and Wei; if we measure Qin's troops, they were not as strong as the three Jin states. Yet it finally united the world. This was not necessarily because of dangerous terrain and advantageous positions, but rather as if Heaven assisted it.",
  "s0012": "Some say: \"Eastern things are where all things begin to be born; western things are where all things reach maturity.\"",
  "s0013": "Those who undertake affairs must do so in the southeast; those who reap actual achievements are constantly in the northwest.",
  "s0014": "Therefore Yu arose from the western Qiang, Tang rose from Bo, King Zhou used Feng and Hao to attack Yin, Qin used Yong province to rise to imperial power, and Han arose from Shu and Han.",
  "s0015": "After Qin achieved its ambitions, it burned the world's poetry and books. The records of the feudal lords were especially severe, because they contained criticisms.",
  "s0016": "The reason poetry and books reappeared was that they were extensively stored in people's homes, but the historical records were uniquely stored in the Zhou court, so they were extinguished.",
  "s0017": "What a pity, what a pity!",
  "s0018": "Only the Qin records remained, but they did not record dates and months, their text was brief and incomplete.",
  "s0019": "However, the stratagems and changes of the Warring States also have much that is worthy of selection. Why must it be ancient times?",
  "s0020": "Qin took the world with much tyranny, yet eras change and transform, and great success was achieved.",
  "s0021": "The tradition says \"follow later kings.\" Why is this?",
  "s0022": "Because they are close to us, and customs and changes are similar, the discussions are lowly and easy to carry out.",
  "s0023": "Scholars are constrained by what they have heard. Seeing that Qin's time on the imperial throne was brief, they do not examine its beginning and end, and thus laugh at it dismissively, not daring to discuss it. This is no different from accepting hearsay without verification.",
  "s0024": "How lamentable!",
  "s0025": "Therefore I have followed the Qin records, continued after the Spring and Autumn Annals, beginning from King Yuan of Zhou, tabulating the events of the six states period, ending with the Second Emperor, altogether 270 years, recording the trends of rise and fall that I have heard about.",
