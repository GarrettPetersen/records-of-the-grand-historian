  "s0751": "Han gives up the effort to Qin, and Zhao receives the benefit. Though strong and great, they cannot obtain it from the weak, but the weak will obtain it from the strong - how can this not be unexpected profit?'",
  "s0752": "Moreover, Qin uses the water of Niu Tian to transport grain, nibbling like a silkworm, with superior forces doubling in battle, tearing apart the great state's territory, their government effective, so they cannot be contended with.'",
  "s0753": "The king said: 'Now if we send a million troops and attack for a year or two without taking one city, now they offer seventeen cities and towns as gifts to my state - this is great profit.'",
  "s0754": "Lord Pingyang went out, and the king summoned Lord Pingyuan and Zhao Yu to tell them.",
  "s0755": "Lord Pingyuan said: 'Accepting it is beneficial.'",
  "s0756": "Zhao Yu said: 'Accepting it is harmful.'",
  "s0757": "The king said: 'How do you see it?'",
  "s0758": "Zhao Yu said: 'Han gives Shangdang to Qin, but the people do not wish to be Qin, so they give it to Zhao. If Zhao does not accept, the people will resent Zhao. If we accept, Qin will be angry and attack, and Zhao will bear the harm.",
  "s0759": "Not accepting Shangdang, Qin and Han will fight, Zhao can sit and watch the profit. This is the plan of the hegemon.'",
