  "s0605": "What Qi trusted Han with was making Han Gong Zi Mei prime minister of Qi.",
  "s0606": "Han had already obtained Wu Sui from Qin, and the king greatly favored it, sending Mei to Qi and Han to meet Mao Li Ji. Ji obtained the weight of Qi and Han, so his lord did not dare abandon Ji.",
  "s0607": "Now if we add Chu's weight to this, Mao Li Zi will surely speak to Qin to return the invaded land to Chu.'",
  "s0608": "Therefore Hui Wang agreed to it, ultimately not allying with Qin but allying with Qi to benefit Han.",
  "s0609": "In the twenty-fourth year, he betrayed Qi and allied with Qin.",
  "s0610": "Qin Zhao Wang first ascended the throne and heavily bribed Chu.",
  "s0611": "Chu went to welcome the bride.",
  "s0612": "In the twenty-fifth year, Hui Wang entered and formed an alliance with Qin Zhao Wang at Huang Ji.",

  "s0616": "Qin then sent the Guest Minister Tong to lead troops to rescue Chu, and the three states withdrew their troops.",

  "s0623": "The crown prince arrogantly killed my important minister without apologizing and fled away. I truly cannot contain my anger, so I sent troops to invade the king's borders.",
  "s0624": "Now I hear the king has sent the crown prince as hostage to Qi to seek peace.",
  "s0625": "I and Chu share bordering lands, so we intermarried, and our alliance has been close for a long time.",
  "s0626": "But now Qin and Chu are not on good terms, which makes it impossible to command the feudal lords.",
  "s0627": "I wish to meet the king at Wu Guan, make a face-to-face agreement, form an alliance, and leave - this is my wish.",

  "s0633": "Qin is like a tiger or wolf, cannot be trusted - they have intentions to swallow the feudal lords.'",
  "s0634": "Hui Wang's son Zi Lan urged the king to go, saying: 'How can we break Qin's friendly intentions!'",
  "s0635": "Therefore he went to meet Qin Zhao Wang.",
  "s0636": "Zhao Wang deceitfully ordered a general to hide troops at Wu Guan, calling himself Qin Wang.",
  "s0637": "When the Chu king arrived, they closed Wu Guan and escorted him west to Xian Yang, where he attended court at Zhang Tai like a vassal, without equal ritual.",
  "s0638": "Chu Hui Wang was greatly angered and regretted not listening to Zhao Sui's words.",
  "s0639": "Qin detained the Chu king and demanded the cession of the Wu and Qian Zhong commanderies.",
  "s0640": "The Chu king wanted to form an alliance, but Qin wanted to get the land first.",
  "s0641": "The Chu king angrily said: 'Qin has deceived me and now forcibly demands land from me!'",
  "s0642": "He would not agree to Qin again.",
  "s0643": "Qin therefore detained him.",
  "s0644": "The Chu ministers were troubled and plotted together: 'Our king is in Qin and cannot return, they demand the cession of land, and the crown prince is hostage in Qi. If Qi and Qin conspire together, then Chu will have no state.'",
  "s0645": "They wanted to establish a son of Hui Wang who was in the country.",
  "s0646": "Zhao Sui said: 'The king and crown prince are both trapped by the feudal lords, and now if we go against the king's command and establish his illegitimate son, it is not proper.'",
  "s0647": "He deceitfully reported to Qi that Qi Min Wang told his prime minister: 'It would be better to detain the crown prince to demand Chu's Huai Bei.'",
  "s0648": "The prime minister said: 'This cannot be done. If Ying establishes a king, then we are holding an empty hostage and acting unjustly toward the world.'",
  "s0649": "Some said: 'Not so.",
  "s0650": "If Ying establishes a king, then bargain with their new king saying 'Give me the lower eastern region, and I will have the king kill the crown prince, otherwise I will ally with the three states to establish him', then the eastern region can surely be obtained.'",
  "s0651": "Qi Wang ultimately used his prime minister's plan and returned the Chu crown prince.",
  "s0652": "The crown prince Heng arrived and was established as king, becoming Qing Xiang Wang.",
  "s0653": "He announced to Qin: 'Relying on the spirits of the altars of soil and grain, the state has a king.'",
  "s0655": "Qing Xiang Wang Heng's first year, Qin demanded Hui Wang but could not get the land.
