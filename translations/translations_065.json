  "s0001": "Sun Tzu Wu was a man from Qi.",
  "s0002": "He presented himself to King Helü of Wu with his military strategies.",
  "s0003": "Helü said: 'I have completely read your thirteen chapters. Could you conduct a small test of drilling troops?'",
  "s0004": "He replied: 'Acceptable.'",
  "s0005": "Helü said: 'Could you test with women?'",
  "s0006": "He said: 'Acceptable.'",
  "s0007": "So he was permitted to do so. Palace ladies were selected, one hundred and eighty of them.",
  "s0008": "Sun Tzu divided them into two teams, with the king's two favored consorts as team leaders for each, and commanded all of them to hold halberds.",
  "s0009": "He commanded them saying: 'Do you know your heart and your left right hand back?'",
  "s0010": "The women said: 'We know them.'",
  "s0011": "Sun Tzu said: 'Forward, then look at the heart;",
  "s0012": "left, look at the left hand;",
  "s0013": "right, look at the right hand;",
  "s0014": "back, then look at the back.'",
  "s0015": "The women said: 'Yes.'",
  "s0016": "Once the rules were laid out, he set up the axe and halberd, and repeated the commands three times and explained them five times.",
  "s0017": "Then he drummed to the right, and the women burst out laughing.",
  "s0018": "Sun Tzu said: 'The rules are unclear, the commands are not familiar—the general's fault.'",
  "s0019": "He repeated the commands three times and explained them five times, then drummed to the left, and the women again burst out laughing.",
  "s0020": "Sun Tzu said: 'The rules are unclear, the commands are not familiar—the general's fault;",
  "s0021": "once they are clear but not followed, it is the officers and soldiers' fault.'",
  "s0022": "He was about to execute the team leaders on left and right.",
  "s0023": "King Wu watched from the terrace above, and seeing that his beloved consorts were about to be executed, he was greatly alarmed.",
  "s0024": "He hurriedly sent a messenger down with orders: 'I already know the general can use troops.",
  "s0025": "Without these two consorts, my food has no flavor. Please do not execute them.'",
  "s0026": "Sun Tzu said: 'I have already received the command to be general; when in the army, the general does not accept the sovereign's orders.'",
  "s0027": "He executed the two team leaders as an example.",
  "s0028": "He appointed their seconds as team leaders, then drummed again.",
  "s0029": "The women moved left right forward back, kneeling and standing—all conformed to the rules and regulations, none dared make a sound.",
  "s0030": "Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to report to the king: 'The troops are now well-ordered. Your Majesty can come down to observe them. Whatever you wish to use them for, even if it means charging into water or fire, they will do it.'",
  "s0031": "King Wu said: 'General, please retire to your quarters. I do not wish to come down and observe.'",
  "s0032": "Sun Tzu said: 'The king only likes the words but cannot use the reality.'",
  "s0033": "Thus Helü knew Sun Tzu could use troops and finally appointed him as general.",
  "s0034": "He broke the strong state of Chu in the west, entered Ying, awed Qi and Jin in the north, made his name illustrious among the feudal lords—Sun Tzu had a role in this.",
  "s0035": "After Sun Wu died, more than a century later there was Sun Bin.",
  "s0036": "Bin was born between Ao and Juan. Bin was also a descendant of Sun Wu's lineage.",
  "s0037": "Sun Bin once studied military strategy together with Pang Juan.",
  "s0038": "After Pang Juan served Wei, he became General to Marquis Hui, but felt his abilities did not match Sun Bin's, so he secretly summoned Sun Bin.",
  "s0039": "When Bin arrived, Pang Juan feared he was more worthy than himself, disliked him, and had his feet cut off and tattooed him to hide him away and not let him be seen.",
  "s0040": "A Qi envoy came to Liang, and Sun Bin, as a criminal laborer, secretly met with him and persuaded him.",
  "s0041": "The Qi envoy considered him extraordinary and secretly carried him back to Qi.",
  "s0042": "The Qi general Tian Ji treated him well as a guest.",
  "s0043": "Ji often raced chariots with the Qi nobles and wagered heavily.",
  "s0044": "Sun Tzu saw that their horses' speeds were not far apart, with horses divided into upper, middle, lower, and lowest grades.",
  "s0045": "So Sun Tzu said to Tian Ji: 'My lord wagers heavily in chariot races. I can make you win.'",
  "s0046": "Tian Ji believed him and wagered a thousand jin with the king and nobles.",
  "s0047": "When it came time for the race, Sun Tzu said: 'Now use your lowest chariot against their highest, your highest against their middle, your middle against their lowest.'",
  "s0048": "After the three rounds were complete, Tian Ji lost one round but won two, and ultimately won the king's thousand jin.",
  "s0049": "So Ji recommended Sun Tzu to King Wei.",
  "s0050": "King Wei asked about military strategy and appointed him as teacher.",
  "s0051": "Afterward, Wei attacked Zhao, Zhao was in dire straits and requested aid from Qi.",
  "s0052": "King Wei of Qi wanted to appoint Sun Bin as general, but Bin declined saying: 'A mutilated criminal cannot.'",
  "s0053": "So they appointed Tian Ji as general and Sun Tzu as advisor, riding in the supply wagon, seated and making plans.",
  "s0054": "Tian Ji wanted to lead troops to Zhao, but Sun Tzu said: 'Those who unravel tangles do not grab the fist, those who save fighters do not strike the head—strike the flanks and attack where empty, block their momentum and restrict their position, and they will resolve themselves.",
  "s0055": "Now Liang and Zhao are attacking each other, their light troops and elite soldiers must be exhausted outside, the old and weak weary inside.",
  "s0056": "My lord should lead troops and swiftly march to Daliang, occupy their thoroughfares, strike their vulnerable points—they will surely abandon Zhao and come to their own rescue.",
  "s0057": "This way we can lift Zhao's siege with one stroke and gain exhausted troops from Wei.'",
  "s0058": "Tian Ji followed this, and Wei indeed left Handan and fought Qi at Guiling, suffering a great defeat.",
  "s0059": "Thirteen years later, Wei and Zhao attacked Han, Han urgently appealed to Qi.",
  "s0060": "Qi sent Tian Ji as general to go, directly marching to Daliang.",
  "s0061": "Wei general Pang Juan heard of it, left Han and returned, but the Qi army had already passed and gone west.",
  "s0062": "Sun Tzu said to Tian Ji: 'The troops of the three Jin states are fierce and brave by nature and look down on Qi. Qi has a reputation for cowardice. Good warriors exploit their momentum and guide it advantageously.",
  "s0063": "Military strategy says: those who pursue advantage a hundred li lose their general, those who pursue advantage fifty li arrive with half their army.",
  "s0064": "Have the Qi army enter Wei territory and make ten thousand cooking fires, the next day five thousand, the day after three thousand.'",
  "s0065": "Pang Juan marched three days and was greatly pleased, saying: 'I knew the Qi army was cowardly. Entering our territory three days, more than half their soldiers have deserted.'",
  "s0066": "He abandoned his infantry and with his light elite doubled their march to pursue them.",
  "s0067": "Sun Tzu calculated their march route—they should arrive at Malings by dusk.",
  "s0068": "The Malings road was narrow, with many obstacles and defiles on the sides, suitable for ambushing troops. They cut a large tree white and wrote on it: 'Pang Juan dies beneath this tree.'",
  "s0069": "Then they ordered the Qi army's best archers with ten thousand crossbows to lie in ambush along the road, setting a time: 'When you see fire at dusk, all fire together.'",
  "s0070": "Pang Juan indeed arrived at night beneath the cut tree, saw the white writing, and lit a torch to read it.",
  "s0071": "He had not finished reading the writing when the Qi army's ten thousand crossbows all fired, and the Wei army fell into great chaos and scattered.",
  "s0072": "Pang Juan knew his wisdom was exhausted and his troops defeated, so he cut his own throat, saying: 'This fulfills the reputation of that boy!'",
  "s0073": "Qi took advantage of the victory to completely destroy their army, capturing Wei's crown prince Shen and returning.",
  "s0074": "Sun Bin thereby became famous throughout the world, and his military strategy was transmitted through the ages.",
  "s0075": "Wu Qi was a man from Wei.",
  "s0076": "He once studied under Zengzi and served the Lord of Lu.",
  "s0077": "When Qi attacked Lu, Lu wanted to appoint Wu Qi as general, but Wu Qi had taken a Qi woman as wife, so Lu suspected him.",
  "s0078": "Wu Qi then wanted to establish his reputation, so he killed his wife to show he had no connection with Qi.",
  "s0079": "Lu finally appointed him as general.",
  "s0080": "As general he attacked Qi and greatly defeated them.",
  "s0081": "Some Lu people spoke ill of Wu Qi saying: 'Qi is a suspicious and cruel person.",
  "s0082": "In his youth, his family had accumulated a thousand jin. He sought office but did not succeed, so he squandered his family fortune. The villagers laughed at him. Wu Qi killed more than thirty of those who slandered him and left east through the Wei city gate.",
  "s0083": "He bid farewell to his mother, bit his arm and swore: 'If I do not become prime minister, I will not return to Wei.'",
  "s0084": "So he served Zengzi.",
  "s0085": "After some time, his mother died, but Qi did not return.",
  "s0086": "Zengzi despised him and broke relations with him.",
  "s0087": "Qi then went to Lu and studied military strategy to serve the Lord of Lu.",
  "s0088": "The Lord of Lu suspected him, so Qi killed his wife to seek the generalship.",
  "s0089": "Lu is a small state, and if it has the name of victory in battle, the feudal lords will covet Lu.",
  "s0090": "Moreover, Lu and Wei are brother states, yet the lord employs Qi, which means abandoning Wei.'",
  "s0091": "The Lord of Lu suspected him and dismissed Wu Qi.",
  "s0092": "Wu Qi then heard that Marquis Wen of Wei was worthy and wanted to serve him.",
  "s0093": "Marquis Wen asked Li Ke: 'What kind of person is Wu Qi?'",
  "s0094": "Li Ke said: 'Qi is greedy and fond of women, but in using troops, even Sima Rangju cannot surpass him.'",
  "s0095": "So Marquis Wen of Wei appointed him as general and attacked Qin, capturing five cities.",
  "s0096": "When Qi was general, he shared clothing and food with the lowest soldiers.",
  "s0097": "He did not lay out mats when sleeping, did not ride when marching, personally wrapped the provisions, sharing hardship with the soldiers.",
  "s0098": "When a soldier had a festering sore, Qi sucked it for him.",
  "s0099": "The soldier's mother heard and wept for him.",
  "s0100": "Someone said: 'Your son is a soldier, and the general himself sucked his sore. Why do you weep?'",
  "s0101": "The mother said: 'It's not that.",
  "s0102": "In previous years Lord Wu sucked my husband's sore, and my husband fought without turning back and died on the battlefield.",
  "s0103": "Now Lord Wu sucks my son's sore again. I don't know where my son will die.'",
  "s0104": "So she wept for him.'",
  "s0105": "Marquis Wen considered Wu Qi skilled in using troops, incorruptible and fair, able to completely win the soldiers' hearts, so he appointed him governor of Xhe to resist Qin and Han.",
  "s0106": "After Marquis Wen of Wei died, Qi served his son Marquis Wu.",
  "s0107": "Marquis Wu floated down the Yellow River, and in midstream turned to say to Wu Qi: 'How beautiful are the mountain and river fortifications—this is Wei's treasure!'",
  "s0108": "Qi replied: 'It depends on virtue, not on natural defenses.",
  "s0109": "In ancient times the Three Miao tribes had Dongting on the left and Pengli on the right. They did not cultivate virtue and righteousness, so Yu destroyed them.",
  "s0110": "Xia Jie resided with the Yellow River on the left and Mount Tai on the right, Yique to the south and Yangchang to the north. He practiced unbenevolent government, so Tang exiled him.",
  "s0111": "King Zhou of Yin had Mengmen on the left and Taihang on the right, Changshan to the north and the great river flowing south. He practiced unde virtuous government, so King Wu killed him.",
  "s0112": "From this we can see it depends on virtue, not on natural defenses.",
  "s0113": "If my lord does not cultivate virtue, everyone in this boat will become the enemy state's people.'",
  "s0114": "Marquis Wu said: 'Excellent.'",
  "s0115": "He appointed Wu Qi as governor of Xhe, and he had great renown.",
  "s0116": "Wei appointed a chancellor, Chancellor Tian Wen.",
  "s0117": "Wu Qi was displeased and said to Tian Wen: 'May I discuss merits with you?'",
  "s0118": "Tian Wen said: 'Acceptable.'",
  "s0119": "Qi said: 'Commanding the three armies, making soldiers gladly die for you, enemy states not daring to plot—who compares to me?'",
  "s0120": "Wen said: 'I do not match you.'",
  "s0121": "Qi said: 'Managing the hundred officials, being close to the ten thousand people, filling the treasuries—who compares to me?'",
  "s0122": "Wen said: 'I do not match you.'",
  "s0123": "Qi said: 'Guarding Xhe so Qin troops dare not face east, making Han and Zhao submit as guests—who compares to me?'",
  "s0124": "Wen said: 'I do not match you.'",
  "s0125": "Qi said: 'In these three matters you are all below me, yet your position is above mine. Why?'",
  "s0126": "Wen said: 'The lord is young, the state uncertain, ministers not yet attached, the people not yet trusting—at such a time, should it be entrusted to you or to me?'",
  "s0127": "Qi was silent for a long time, then said: 'It should be entrusted to you.'",
  "s0128": "Wen said: 'This is why I am above you.'",
  "s0129": "Wu Qi then realized he was not equal to Tian Wen.",
  "s0130": "After Tian Wen died, Gongsun became chancellor. He married the Wei princess but harmed Wu Qi.",
  "s0131": "Gongsun's servant said: 'Qi can be easily removed.'",
  "s0132": "Gongsun said: 'How?'",
  "s0133": "His servant said: 'Qi is frugal and self-satisfied with his reputation.",
  "s0134": "My lord should first speak to Marquis Wu: 'Wu Qi is a worthy person, but your lordship's state is small and borders strong Qin. I privately fear Qi may not be wholeheartedly devoted.'",
  "s0135": "Marquis Wu will say: 'What then?'",
  "s0136": "My lord then says to Marquis Wu: 'Test him by betrothing him the princess. If he has devotion he will certainly accept.",
  "s0137": "If he has no devotion he will certainly decline.",
  "s0138": "Use this to divine it.'",
  "s0139": "My lord then summons Wu Qi and betroths him the princess, immediately making the princess angry and insulting my lord.",
  "s0140": "When Wu Qi sees the princess insulting the Wei chancellor, he will certainly decline.'",
  "s0141": "So Wu Qi saw the princess insulting the Wei chancellor and indeed declined Marquis Wu.",
  "s0142": "Marquis Wu suspected it but did not believe.",
  "s0143": "Wu Qi feared punishment, so he left and went to Chu.",
  "s0144": "King Dao of Chu had long heard Qi was worthy, and upon his arrival appointed him chancellor of Chu.",
  "s0145": "He clarified the laws and examined the commands, abolished unnecessary officials, dismissed distant royal clansmen, to nurture and fight with the soldiers.",
  "s0146": "He emphasized strengthening the troops, rejecting the words of the strategists who spoke of alliances and confederacies.",
  "s0147": "Thus he pacified Baiyue in the south;",
  "s0148": "annexed Chen and Cai in the north, drove back the three Jin;",
  "s0149": "attacked Qin in the west.",
  "s0150": "The feudal lords feared Chu's strength.",
  "s0151": "Therefore Chu's nobles all wanted to harm Wu Qi.",
  "s0152": "When King Dao died, the royal clansmen and ministers rebelled and attacked Wu Qi. Wu Qi fled to the king's corpse and lay upon it.",
  "s0153": "Those attacking Qi then shot and stabbed Wu Qi, also hitting King Dao.",
  "s0154": "After King Dao was buried, the crown prince ascended and had the chief minister execute all those who shot Wu Qi and hit the king's corpse.",
  "s0155": "Those executed for shooting Qi and whose clans were exterminated numbered more than seventy families.",
  "s0156": "The Grand Historian says: What the world commonly calls military works all discuss Sun Tzu's thirteen chapters and Wu Qi's military strategy. The world has many, so I will not discuss them, but will discuss their actions and achievements.",
  "s0157": "The saying goes: 'Those who can act may not be able to speak, those who can speak may not be able to act.'",
  "s0158": "Sun Tzu clearly strategized against Pang Juan, yet could not early save himself from punishment.",
  "s0159": "Wu Qi explained to Marquis Wu that terrain depends on virtue, yet when he acted in Chu he was harsh and cruel, lacking benevolence, and lost his life.",
  "s0160": "Alas!",
  "s0161": "Alas!"
