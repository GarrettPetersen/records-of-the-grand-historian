            <div class="english-text">Empress Dowager Lü was Gao Zu&#039;s consort from his humble days; she gave birth to Emperor Xiaohui and her daughter Grand Empress Dowager Lu Yuan. When Gao Zu became King of Han, he obtained Consort Qi of Dingtao, whom he loved and favored; she gave birth to King Yin of Zhao, Ruyi. Emperor Xiaohui as a person was benevolent and weak; Gao Zu considered he did not resemble him and constantly wished to depose the Crown Prince and install Consort Qi&#039;s son Ruyi, who resembled him. Consort Qi was favored and constantly followed the superior east of the passes, weeping day and night, wishing to have her son replace the Crown Prince. Empress Lü was older and constantly remained behind on guard duty, rarely seeing the superior, and grew increasingly estranged. After Ruyi was installed as King of Zhao, he nearly replaced the Crown Prince several times; they relied on the great ministers to争 for it, as well as the Marquis of Liu&#039;s strategy, and the Crown Prince was able to avoid being deposed.</div>

            <div class="english-text">Empress Lü most resented Consort Qi and her son the King of Zhao, so she ordered Consort Qi imprisoned in the Eternal Lanes and summoned the King of Zhao. After the envoy went three times, Zhao Prime Minister Marquis of Jianping Zhou Chang said to the envoy: &quot;The High Emperor entrusted the King of Zhao to me; the King of Zhao is young. I have secretly heard the Empress Dowager resents Consort Qi and wishes to summon the King of Zhao to execute them together; I dare not send the king. Moreover, the king is also ill and cannot obey the edict.&quot; Empress Lü was greatly enraged and sent men to summon the Zhao Prime Minister. The Zhao Prime Minister was summoned to Chang&#039;an, and she then sent men again to summon the King of Zhao. The king came but had not yet arrived. Emperor Xiaohui was compassionate and benevolent; knowing the Empress Dowager was angry, he personally welcomed the King of Zhao at Bashang, entered the palace with him, and personally stayed close to the King of Zhao in daily activities and meals. The Empress Dowager wished to kill him but could not find an opportunity. In the twelfth month of the first year of Emperor Xiaohui, the emperor went out at dawn to practice archery. The King of Zhao was young and could not rise early. The Empress Dowager heard he was alone and sent someone with poisoned wine for him to drink. At dawn, Emperor Xiaohui returned; the King of Zhao was already dead. Thereupon they moved King You of Huaiyang to be King of Zhao. In summer, an edict bestowed on the Marquis of Li&#039;s father the posthumous title Lingwu Marquis. The Empress Dowager then cut off Consort Qi&#039;s hands and feet, gouged out her eyes, seared her ears, made her drink a muting drug, had her reside in the privy, and named her &#039;Human Pig.&#039; After several days, she summoned Emperor Xiaohui to observe the Human Pig. Emperor Xiaohui saw her, inquired, and then knew it was Consort Qi; he then wept loudly, consequently fell ill, and for over a year could not rise. He sent someone to request of the Empress Dowager: &quot;This is not something a person would do. I am the Empress Dowager&#039;s son, yet in the end I cannot govern all under Heaven.&quot; From this day Emperor Xiaohui daily drank for dissolute pleasure and did not attend to government, which is why he had illness.</div>

            <div class="chinese-text">二年，楚元王、齊悼惠王皆來朝。十月，孝惠與齊王燕飲太后前，孝惠以為齊王兄，置上坐，如家人之禮。太后怒，乃令酌兩卮酖，置前，令齊王起為壽。齊王起，孝惠亦起，取卮欲俱為壽。太后乃恐，自起泛孝惠卮。齊王怪之，因不敢飲，詳醉去。問，知其酖，齊王恐，自以為不得脫長安，憂。齊內史士說王曰：「太后獨有孝惠與魯元公主。今王有七十餘城，而公主乃食數城。王誠以一郡上太后，為公主湯沐邑，太后必喜，王必無憂。」於是齊王乃上城陽之郡，尊公主為王太后。呂后喜，許之。乃置酒齊邸，樂飲，罷，歸齊王。三年，方筑長安城，四年就半，五年六年城就。諸侯來會。十月朝賀。</div>
            <div class="english-text">In the second year, King Yuan of Chu and King Daohui of Qi both came to court. In the tenth month, Emperor Xiaohui held a banquet and drank with the King of Qi before the Empress Dowager; Emperor Xiaohui considered the King of Qi his elder brother, placed him in the seat of honor, following the rites of family members. The Empress Dowager was angry and ordered two cups of poison poured and placed before them, ordering the King of Qi to rise and offer a toast. The King of Qi rose; Emperor Xiaohui also rose, took the cup wishing to toast together. The Empress Dowager was then afraid and personally rose to overturn Emperor Xiaohui&#039;s cup. The King of Qi found this strange and consequently did not dare drink, feigned drunkenness, and departed. Inquiring, he learned it was poison; the King of Qi was afraid, considering he could not escape Chang&#039;an alive, and worried. Qi&#039;s Internal Administrator Shi persuaded the king, saying: &quot;The Empress Dowager only has Emperor Xiaohui and Princess Lu Yuan. Now the king has over seventy cities, while the princess eats from only several cities. If the king truly offers one commandery to the Empress Dowager as a bathing estate for the princess, the Empress Dowager will certainly be pleased and the king will certainly have no worries.&quot; Thereupon the King of Qi offered up the commandery of Chengyang and honored the princess as Queen Dowager. Empress Lü was pleased and permitted it. She then held a banquet at the Qi residence, drank in enjoyment, dismissed it, and returned the King of Qi. In the third year, they were constructing the walls of Chang&#039;an; in the fourth year half was completed; in the fifth and sixth years the walls were completed. The feudal lords came to assemble. In the tenth month they came to court to offer congratulations.</div>

            <div class="english-text">On the wuyin day of the eighth month in the seventh year of autumn, Emperor Xiaohui died. The death was announced; the Empress Dowager cried but tears did not fall. The Marquis of Liu&#039;s son Zhang Biqiang was an attendant, age fifteen, and said to the prime minister: &quot;The Empress Dowager only had Emperor Xiaohui; now he has died and she cries without grief—do you know why?&quot; The prime minister said: &quot;What is the reason?&quot; Biqiang said: &quot;The emperor has no grown sons; the Empress Dowager fears you lords. If you lords now request to appoint Lü Tai, Lü Chan, and Lü Lu as generals commanding troops stationed at the Southern and Northern Armies, and have all the Lü clan enter the palace to reside within and handle affairs—if this is done then the Empress Dowager&#039;s heart will be at ease and you lords will be fortunate to escape disaster.&quot; The prime minister then followed Biqiang&#039;s plan. The Empress Dowager was pleased and her crying then became sorrowful. The Lü clan&#039;s power arose from this. They then granted a great amnesty to all under Heaven. On the xinchou day of the ninth month, they buried him. The Crown Prince assumed the position as Emperor and made obeisance at the High Temple. In the first year, all orders issued from the Empress Dowager.</div>

            <div class="english-text">The Empress Dowager held power and discussed wishing to install various Lü as kings; she asked Right Prime Minister Wang Ling. Wang Ling said: &quot;The High Emperor slaughtered a white horse and made an oath saying &#039;If any non-Liu becomes king, all under Heaven shall together strike them.&#039; Now to make the Lü kings is not in accord with the agreement.&quot; The Empress Dowager was not pleased. She asked Left Prime Minister Chen Ping and Marquis of Jiang Zhou Bo. Bo and the others replied: &quot;The High Emperor settled all under Heaven and made kings of his sons and younger brothers; now the Empress Dowager holds power—making kings of brothers and the various Lü, there is nothing improper about it.&quot; The Empress Dowager was pleased and dismissed the court. Wang Ling reproached Chen Ping and Marquis of Jiang, saying: &quot;At first when we licked blood with the High Emperor in oath—were you lords not present? Now the High Emperor has died, the Empress Dowager is a female lord wishing to make the Lü kings, and you lords follow desires to flatter her intentions and betray the agreement—with what face will you see the High Emperor below ground?&quot; Chen Ping and Marquis of Jiang said: &quot;In opposing face to face and arguing at court now, we ministers are not your equal; but in preserving the altars of soil and grain and stabilizing the Liu clan&#039;s succession, you are also not our equal.&quot; Wang Ling had no response. In the eleventh month, the Empress Dowager wishing to remove Wang Ling appointed him Grand Tutor of the Emperor, taking away his prime ministerial authority. Wang Ling then pleaded illness, was dismissed, and returned home. She then made Left Prime Minister Ping Right Prime Minister and made Marquis of Biyang Shen Yiji Left Prime Minister. The Left Prime Minister did not handle affairs but was ordered to supervise within the palace, like a Gentleman of the Palace. Yiji had formerly obtained the Empress Dowager&#039;s favor and constantly handled affairs; the dukes and ministers all went through him to decide matters. They then posthumously honored the Marquis of Li&#039;s father as King Daowu, wishing to use this as a gradual approach to making the various Lü kings.</div>

I am not yet grown; when I am grown I will make changes.&quot; The Empress Dowager heard this and was troubled by it; fearing he would create disorder, she imprisoned him in the Eternal Coils, said the emperor was severely ill, and none of those around him could see him.

            <div class="english-text">In the seventh month, the High Empress&#039;s illness was severe; she then ordered King Lü Lu of Zhao to be Supreme General commanding the Northern Army; King Chan of Lü commanded the Southern Army. Empress Dowager Lü admonished Chan and Lu, saying: &quot;The High Emperor having settled all under Heaven made an agreement with the great ministers saying &#039;If any non-Liu becomes king, all under Heaven shall together strike them.&#039; Now the Lü have become kings; the great ministers are displeased. When I die, the emperor is young; the great ministers fear making changes. You must control troops to defend the palace; be careful not to attend the funeral and not be controlled by others.&quot; On the xinsi day, the High Empress died; her testament bestowed a thousand gold each to the feudal lord kings; generals, ministers, ranked marquises, gentlemen, and officials were all bestowed gold according to rank. They granted a great amnesty to all under Heaven. They made King Chan of Lü Prime Minister and made Lü Lu&#039;s daughter Empress.</div>

Both were younger brothers of King Ai of Qi, residing in Chang&#039;an.

On the bingwu day of the eighth month, the King of Qi wished to have someone execute the prime minister; Prime Minister Zhao Ping then rebelled, raising troops wishing to surround the king; the king consequently killed his prime minister, then sent troops east, deceitfully seized the King of Langye&#039;s troops, combined command of them, and went west.

            <div class="english-text">The King of Qi then sent letters to the feudal lord kings saying: &quot;The High Emperor pacified and settled all under Heaven and made kings of his sons and younger brothers; King Daohui ruled Qi. When King Daohui died, Emperor Xiaohui sent Marquis of Liu Liang to install me as King of Qi. Emperor Xiaohui died; the High Empress handled affairs, was advanced in years, listened to the various Lü, arbitrarily deposed the emperor and installed another, also successively killed three Kings of Zhao, exterminated Liang, Zhao, and Yan to make the various Lü kings, and divided Qi into four. Loyal ministers advanced remonstrations but the superior was confused and disordered and would not listen. Now the High Empress has died, and the emperor is young, unable to govern all under Heaven, necessarily relying on the great ministers and feudal lords. Yet the various Lü have again arbitrarily elevated their own offices, gathered troops to amass authority, coerced ranked marquises and loyal ministers, and falsely issued edicts to command all under Heaven—this is why the ancestral temples are endangered. I lead troops to enter and execute those who should not be kings.&quot; Han hearing of this, Prime Minister Lü Chan and others then sent Marquis of Yingyin Guan Ying to lead troops to strike them. Guan Ying reached Yingyang and plotted, saying: &quot;The various Lü control troops within the passes, wishing to endanger the Liu clan and install themselves. Now if I break Qi and return to report, this will increase the Lü clan&#039;s resources.&quot; He then remained encamped at Yingyang, sent envoys to instruct the King of Qi and the feudal lords, made alliance with them, and waited for the Lü clan to make changes to together execute them. The King of Qi heard this and then returned his troops to the western border to await the agreement.</div>

Request the King of Liang to return the prime minister&#039;s seal, make an oath with the great ministers and go to your state; the Qi troops will certainly be dismissed, the great ministers will be at ease, and you will rest easy while ruling a thousand li—this is benefit for ten thousand generations.&quot; Lü Lu believed and agreed with this plan, wishing to return the general&#039;s seal and hand over troops to the Grand Commandant.
