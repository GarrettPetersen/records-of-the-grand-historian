            <div class="english-text">Gao Zu was from Zhongyangli in Feng township, Pei, with the surname Liu and given name Ji. His father was called the Grand Duke; his mother was called Dame Liu. Previously his mother Dame Liu was resting by the embankment of a great marsh and dreamed she encountered a spirit. At that time there was thunder and lightning with darkness; the Grand Duke went to look and saw a scaly dragon above her. Soon after she became pregnant and gave birth to Gao Zu.</div>

            <div class="english-text">Gao Zu as a person had a high-bridged nose and dragon-like countenance, fine whiskers and beard, and seventy-two black moles on his left thigh. He was benevolent and loved people, delighted in giving, and his spirit was open and expansive. He always had a generous nature and did not attend to his family&#039;s productive work. When he grew up, he tested for official service and became Pavilion Head of Sishui; among the clerks of the court there was none he did not treat familiarly or make sport of; he loved wine and women. He often bought wine on credit from Dame Wang and Wu Fu; when drunk and lying down, Wu Fu and Dame Wang saw that above him there was always a dragon—they found this strange. Whenever Gao Zu bought and lingered drinking, the wine debt would be multiplied several times. When they saw these strange signs, at year&#039;s end these two households would always tear up the debt markers and forgive the debt.</div>

            <div class="english-text">Lü Gong of Shanfu was on good terms with the Pei magistrate; fleeing from a vendetta he came to lodge with him and consequently made his home in Pei. The heroic gentlemen and officials of Pei heard that the magistrate had an important guest and all went to offer congratulations. Xiao He was the supervising clerk in charge of reception; he issued orders to all the gentlemen saying: &quot;Those whose gifts are less than a thousand cash shall sit in the lower hall.&quot; Gao Zu as Pavilion Head had always treated the officials casually, so he falsely wrote on his visiting card &#039;Gift of ten thousand cash,&#039; though he actually carried not a single coin. When the card was sent in, Lü Gong was greatly surprised, rose, and welcomed him at the gate. Lü Gong liked reading people&#039;s physiognomy; seeing Gao Zu&#039;s appearance, he consequently held him in high regard, invited him in, and seated him. Xiao He said: &quot;Liu Ji is always full of grand talk but accomplishes little.&quot; Gao Zu then treated the guests familiarly and sat in the seat of honor without any humility. When the wine was exhausted, Lü Gong signaled with his eyes to make Gao Zu stay. Gao Zu finished the wine and remained after. Lü Gong said: &quot;I have long liked reading physiognomy and have read many people, but none compare to Ji&#039;s; I hope Ji will take care of himself. I have a daughter and wish her to be Ji&#039;s humble wife.&quot; When the wine ended, Dame Lü was angry at Lü Gong, saying: &quot;You always wanted to treat this daughter as exceptional and give her to a noble person. The Pei magistrate is on good terms with you and sought her but you did not give her—why do you rashly promise her to Liu Ji?&quot; Lü Gong said: &quot;This is not something children and women can understand.&quot; He finally gave her to Liu Ji. Lü Gong&#039;s daughter was Empress Lü; she gave birth to Emperor Xiaohui and Princess Lu Yuan.</div>

            <div class="english-text">When Gao Zu was Pavilion Head, he would often request leave to return to his fields. Empress Lü with her two children were in the fields weeding when an old man passed by and requested a drink; Empress Lü consequently fed him. The old man read Empress Lü&#039;s physiognomy and said: &quot;Madam will be the most noble person under Heaven.&quot; He asked to read the two children&#039;s physiognomy; seeing Xiaohui, he said: &quot;The reason Madam will be noble is because of this boy.&quot; Reading Lu Yuan&#039;s physiognomy, she would also be noble. After the old man left, Gao Zu happened to come from a neighboring house; Empress Lü fully told him that a guest had passed by and read the physiognomy of her and the children, all predicting great nobility. Gao Zu asked where he was; she said: &quot;Not far.&quot; He then pursued and caught up with the old man and questioned him. The old man said: &quot;Earlier your wife and children all resemble you; your physiognomy indicates nobility beyond description.&quot; Gao Zu then bowed and said: &quot;If it is truly as you say, I dare not forget this kindness.&quot; When Gao Zu became noble, they never found where the old man was.</div>

            <div class="english-text">As Pavilion Head, Gao Zu escorted convicts for the county to Mount Li; many escaped on the road. He estimated that by the time they arrived all would have fled, so reaching the marshes west of Feng, he stopped to drink, and at night released all the convicts he was escorting. He said: &quot;You may all go; I too will depart from here!&quot; Among the convicts over ten brave men wished to follow him. Gao Zu, intoxicated, traveled by night through the marshes and ordered one man to go ahead. The man going ahead returned and reported: &quot;There is a great snake blocking the path ahead; we should turn back.&quot; Gao Zu, drunk, said: &quot;A brave man goes forward—what is there to fear!&quot; He then went forward, drew his sword, and struck and beheaded the snake. The snake was split in two and the path opened. After traveling several li, drunk, he lay down to sleep. People coming after arrived at the snake&#039;s location; there was an old woman crying at night. People asked why she cried; the old woman said: &quot;Someone killed my son, therefore I cry.&quot; People said: &quot;Why was your son killed?&quot; The old woman said: &quot;My son is the son of the White Emperor; he transformed into a snake and blocked the road; now he was beheaded by the son of the Red Emperor, therefore I cry.&quot; People thought the old woman was lying and wanted to punish her, but the old woman suddenly disappeared. When the people behind arrived, Gao Zu awoke. The people behind told Gao Zu; Gao Zu was secretly delighted in his heart and felt self-assured. Those who followed him grew daily more in awe of him.</div>

            <div class="english-text">The First Emperor of Qin often said &quot;In the southeast there is the qi of a Son of Heaven,&quot; and consequently made eastern tours to suppress it. Gao Zu then suspected it was himself, fled and hid, concealing himself among the cliffs and rocks of the marshes and mountains of Mang and Dang. Empress Lü with others sought him and always found him. Gao Zu found this strange and questioned her. Empress Lü said: &quot;Where Ji resides there is always cloud qi above, so following it I always find Ji.&quot; Gao Zu was pleased in his heart. Some of the young men of Pei heard of this and many wished to attach themselves to him.</div>

The Pei magistrate was afraid and wished to have Pei respond to She. Assistant clerks and supervising officials Xiao He and Cao Can then said: &quot;You are a Qin official; now if you wish to betray it and lead the sons and younger brothers of Pei, I fear they will not obey.

            <div class="english-text">Thereupon Fan Kuai followed Liu Ji and came. The Pei magistrate later regretted it, fearing there would be trouble, so he closed the city gates to defend the city and wished to execute Xiao and Cao. Xiao and Cao were afraid and climbed over the wall to join Liu Ji. Liu Ji then wrote on silk and shot it over the city wall, saying to the elders of Pei: &quot;All under Heaven has long suffered under Qin. Now though the elders support the Pei magistrate in defending, the feudal lords are rising together and will now massacre Pei. If Pei now together executes the magistrate and chooses from among the sons and younger brothers one who can be installed and installs him to respond to the feudal lords, then households will be preserved intact. If not, fathers and sons will all be massacred—there is no point.&quot; The elders then led the sons and younger brothers to together kill the Pei magistrate, opened the city gates, and welcomed Liu Ji, wishing to make him Pei magistrate. Liu Ji said: &quot;All under Heaven is in chaos; the feudal lords are rising together; now if we install a general who is not good, with one defeat all will be lost. It is not that I dare be selfish, but I fear my abilities are meager and I cannot keep safe the fathers, elder brothers, sons, and younger brothers. This is a great matter; I hope you will again recommend and choose someone suitable.&quot; Xiao, Cao, and the others were all civil clerks who cherished themselves; fearing that if the affair did not succeed Qin would later exterminate their clans, they all deferred to Liu Ji. All the elders said: &quot;Throughout life we have heard of the various strange and wondrous signs about Liu Ji; he should be noble; moreover, divining by oracle, none is as auspicious as Liu Ji.&quot; Thereupon Liu Ji declined several times. Since none of the multitude dared take it, they installed Ji as Duke of Pei. They made offerings to the Yellow Emperor, sacrificed to Chiyou in the courtyard of Pei, and consecrated drums and flags—all banners were red. Because the snake he killed was the son of the White Emperor and the killer was the son of the Red Emperor, therefore they honored red. Thereupon young heroes and officials like Xiao, Cao, and Fan Kuai all gathered two or three thousand sons and younger brothers of Pei, attacked Huling and Fangyu, and returned to defend Feng.</div>

Yan, Zhao, Qi, and Wei all made themselves kings. The Xiang clan arose in Wu. The Supervisor of Sichuan, Ping, led troops to surround Feng for two days; they came out to do battle and broke them. He ordered Yong Chi to defend Feng and led his troops to Xue. The Administrator of Sizhou, Zhuang, was defeated at Xue and fled to Qi; the Duke of Pei&#039;s Left Major captured Administrator Zhuang of Sichuan and killed him. The Duke of Pei returned his army to Kangfu, reached Fangyu, and had not yet fought. King Chen sent Zhou Shi of Wei to take territory. Zhou Shi sent someone to say to Yong Chi: &quot;Feng was formerly a Liang relocated town. Now the Wei territory that has been settled numbers several tens of cities. If Chi now surrenders to Wei, Wei will make Chi a marquis defending Feng. If you do not surrender, we will massacre Feng.&quot; Yong Chi had long been unwilling to be subordinate to the Duke of Pei; when Wei recruited him, he immediately rebelled and defended Feng for Wei. The Duke of Pei led troops to attack Feng but could not take it. The Duke of Pei fell ill and returned to Pei. The Duke of Pei resented that Yong Chi and the sons and younger brothers of Feng had betrayed him; hearing that Lord Ning of Dongyang and Qin Jia had installed Jing Ju as Provisional King at Liu, he went to join them, wishing to request troops to attack Feng. At this time Qin general Zhang Han came from Chen; a separate general, Sima Yi, led troops to pacify Chu territory to the north, massacred Xiang, and reached Dang. Lord Ning of Dongyang and the Duke of Pei led troops west and fought with them west of Xiao; it went unfavorably. They returned to gather troops and assembled at Liu, then led troops to attack Dang, taking it after three days. Consequently gathering Dang&#039;s troops, they obtained five or six thousand men. They attacked Xiayi and took it. They returned the army to Feng. Hearing that Xiang Liang was at Xue, he went with over a hundred cavalry to see him. Xiang Liang augmented the Duke of Pei&#039;s troops with five thousand men and ten commanders of the fifth rank. The Duke of Pei returned and led troops to attack Feng.</div>

Moreover, Chu has repeatedly advanced offensively; previously King Chen and Xiang Liang both were defeated. It would be better to send an elder to uphold righteousness and go west, to inform and instruct the fathers and elder brothers of Qin. The fathers and elder brothers of Qin have long suffered under their lord; now if we truly obtain an elder to go who does not invade or commit violence, they should be amenable to surrender. Now Xiang Yu is fierce and violent; he cannot be sent. Only the Duke of Pei has always been generous and magnanimous, an elder; he can be sent.&quot; In the end they did not permit Xiang Yu, but sent the Duke of Pei west to take territory and gather the scattered troops of King Chen and Xiang Liang. They then went by way of Dang to Chengyang and with Qin troops at Gangli faced each other across ramparts, breaking the two Qin armies. The Chu army sent out troops to strike Wang Li and greatly broke him.</div>

Going south, they fought east of Luoyang; the army went unfavorably, so they returned to Yangcheng, gathered cavalry within the army, and fought with Nanyang Administrator Qi east of Chu, breaking him. They took Nanyang Commandery; Administrator Qi fled and defended and held the city of Wan. The Duke of Pei led his troops to pass by and go west. Zhang Liang remonstrated, saying: &quot;Though the Duke of Pei wishes to urgently enter the passes, Qin troops are still numerous and hold dangerous positions. Now if we do not take Wan, Wan will strike from behind, while strong Qin is ahead—this is a dangerous path.&quot; Thereupon the Duke of Pei led his troops by night from another road and returned, changed flags and banners, and at dawn surrounded Wan city three times round. The Administrator of Nanyang wished to slit his own throat. His retainer Chen Hui said: &quot;It is not too late to die.&quot; He then climbed over the city wall to see the Duke of Pei and said: &quot;I have heard of your agreement: he who first enters Xianyang shall be its king. Now you remain besieging Wan. Wan is the capital of a great commandery with dozens of connected cities, numerous people, and abundant stores; the officials and people believe that if they surrender they will certainly die, therefore all firmly defend and man the walls. Now if you spend the whole day attacking, officers and troops who die or are wounded will certainly be many; if you lead troops away from Wan, Wan will certainly follow behind you; ahead you will lose the agreement about Xianyang, and behind you will have the trouble of strong Wan. Planning for you, nothing would be better than to agree to accept surrender, enfeoff their administrator, consequently have him remain defending, and lead his armored troops with you westward. Cities that have not yet surrendered, hearing the news, will compete to open their gates and wait; you will pass through everywhere without obstruction.&quot; The Duke of Pei said: &quot;Excellent.&quot; He then made the Administrator of Wan Marquis of Yin and enfeoffed Chen Hui with a thousand households. Leading troops westward, there were none that did not surrender. Reaching Danshui, Marquis Gaowu Sai and Marquis Xiang Wang Ling surrendered at Xiling. Returning they attacked Huyang, met Lord Fan&#039;s separate general Mei Xuan, went together with them, and accepted the surrender of Xi and Li. They dispatched Ning Chang of Wei as envoy to Qin, but the envoy had not yet returned. At this time Zhang Han had already surrendered his army to Xiang Yu at Zhao.</div>

            <div class="english-text">Initially, Xiang Yu with Song Yi had gone north to rescue Zhao; when Xiang Yu killed Song Yi and replaced him as Supreme General, all the generals including Qing Bu were subordinated to him; he broke Qin general Wang Li&#039;s army, accepted Zhang Han&#039;s surrender, and all the feudal lords attached themselves. When Zhao Gao had already killed the Second Emperor, he sent men to come wishing to make an agreement to divide and rule Guanzhong. The Duke of Pei considered this deceitful, so he used Zhang Liang&#039;s stratagem, sending Li Sheng and Lu Jia to persuade the Qin generals, enticing them with benefits, and consequently launched a surprise attack on Wuguan, breaking it. They again fought with the Qin army south of Lantian, increased deceptive troop flags and banners; wherever they passed they were not to plunder; the Qin people were pleased, the Qin army relaxed, and they consequently greatly broke them. Again fighting to their north, they greatly broke them. Riding victory, they then broke them completely.</div>

            <div class="english-text">In the tenth month of the first year of Han, the Duke of Pei&#039;s troops were thus first among the feudal lords to reach Bashang. The King of Qin, Ziying, in a plain chariot drawn by white horses, with a cord tied around his neck, sealed the Emperor&#039;s seal, tallies, and tokens, and surrendered by the side of Zhidao. Some generals spoke of executing the King of Qin. The Duke of Pei said: &quot;At first when King Huai sent me, it was precisely because I am capable of being tolerant and magnanimous; moreover, the man has already submitted in surrender—to kill him again would be inauspicious.&quot; He then handed the King of Qin over to officials and proceeded west into Xianyang. He wished to stop and rest in the palaces, but Fan Kuai and Zhang Liang remonstrated; he then sealed Qin&#039;s precious treasures, wealth, and goods in the treasuries, and returned his army to Bashang. He summoned the elders and heroes of the various counties and said: &quot;The elders have long suffered under Qin&#039;s harsh laws; those who spoke ill had their clans exterminated, those who spoke together in pairs were executed in the marketplace. I made an agreement with the feudal lords: he who first enters the passes shall be its king; I should be king of Guanzhong. I make an agreement with the elders—laws of only three articles: he who kills shall die, he who wounds others or steals shall be punished accordingly. All the rest of Qin&#039;s laws are eliminated. All officials and people shall remain peacefully as before. The reason I have come is to eliminate harm for the elders, not to invade or commit violence—have no fear! Moreover, the reason I have returned my army to Bashang is to wait for the feudal lords to arrive and establish agreements.&quot; He then sent people with Qin officials to go through the counties, districts, and townships to inform and instruct them. The Qin people were greatly pleased and competed to bring oxen, sheep, wine, and food to offer feasts for the soldiers. The Duke of Pei again declined and would not accept, saying: &quot;The granaries have abundant grain; there is no scarcity—I do not wish to burden the people.&quot; The people were even more pleased and only feared the Duke of Pei would not become King of Qin.</div>

            <div class="english-text">Someone persuaded the Duke of Pei, saying: &quot;Qin is ten times richer than all under Heaven, and its terrain is strong. Now I hear Zhang Han has surrendered to Xiang Yu, and Xiang Yu has taken the title King of Yong to rule Guanzhong. Now if he comes, the Duke of Pei fears you will not be able to possess this. You should urgently send troops to defend Hangu Pass, not admit the feudal lords&#039; armies, and gradually conscript troops from Guanzhong to strengthen yourself and resist them.&quot; The Duke of Pei agreed with this plan and followed it. In the eleventh month, Xiang Yu indeed led the feudal lords&#039; troops west wishing to enter the passes, but the pass gates were closed. Hearing that the Duke of Pei had already settled Guanzhong, he was greatly enraged and sent Qing Bu and others to attack and break through Hangu Pass. In the twelfth month, they then reached Xi. The Duke of Pei&#039;s Left Major Cao Wushang heard that King Xiang was angry and wished to attack the Duke of Pei, so he sent someone to tell Xiang Yu: &quot;The Duke of Pei wishes to be king of Guanzhong, make Ziying prime minister, and possess all the precious treasures.&quot; He wished to seek enfeoffment by this. The Second Father urged Xiang Yu to strike the Duke of Pei. They were feasting the troops and would join battle the next day. At that time Xiang Yu had four hundred thousand troops, claimed to be a million. The Duke of Pei had one hundred thousand troops, claimed to be two hundred thousand; in strength they were no match. It happened that Xiang Bo wished to save Zhang Liang&#039;s life; by night he went to see Liang and consequently with elegant words persuaded Xiang Yu, and Xiang Yu then desisted. The Duke of Pei with over a hundred cavalry galloped to Hongmen to see and apologize to Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu said: &quot;This was told by the Duke of Pei&#039;s Left Major Cao Wushang. If not, how would I have come to this suspicion!&quot; The Duke of Pei through Fan Kuai and Zhang Liang&#039;s efforts was able to be released and return. Returning, he immediately executed Cao Wushang.</div>

As they departed they immediately burned and severed the plank roads to prepare against the feudal lords&#039; troops raiding them, and also to show Xiang Yu they had no intention of going east. Reaching Nanzheng, many generals and officers and troops escaped on the road and returned; the officers and troops all sang songs longing to return east. Han Xin persuaded the King of Han, saying: &quot;Xiang Yu made kings of generals who had achievements, while the king alone resides at Nanzheng—this is exile. The military officers and troops are all men from east of the mountains; day and night they stand on tiptoe longing to return—use them while they are at their peak and you can achieve great merit.

Xiang Yu resented Tian Rong and installed Qi general Tian Du as King of Qi. Tian Rong was angry and consequently made himself King of Qi, killed Tian Du, and rebelled against Chu; gave Peng Yue a general&#039;s seal and ordered him to rebel in the land of Liang.

He also forcibly killed the surrendered King of Qin, Ziying—crime five. He deceitfully buried alive two hundred thousand Qin sons and younger brothers at Xin&#039;an and made their generals kings—crime six. Xiang Yu made kings of all the generals in good lands while moving and expelling the former lords, causing ministers and subordinates to compete in rebellion and treason—crime seven. Xiang Yu expelled the Righteous Emperor from Pengcheng and made it his own capital, seized the King of Han&#039;s territory, and combined to rule Liang and Chu, taking much for himself—crime eight. Xiang Yu sent men to secretly assassinate the Righteous Emperor south of the Yangtze—crime nine. Being a minister who assassinates his lord, kills those who have already surrendered, governs unjustly, does not keep agreements with his lord—these all under Heaven cannot tolerate; this is great rebellion and lawlessness—crime ten. I with righteous troops follow the feudal lords to execute cruel rebels; I will have criminals with sentences of mutilation strike and kill Xiang Yu—why would I suffer to challenge you to combat!&quot; Xiang Yu was greatly enraged; with a hidden crossbow he shot and hit the King of Han.

When Liu Jia entered Chu territory and besieged Shouchun, the King of Han was defeated at Biling, so he sent envoys to summon Grand Marshal Zhou Yin to raise the troops of Jiujiang and welcome King Wu, marched and massacred Chengfu, following Liu Jia; the feudal lords of Qi and Liang all assembled in great numbers at Gaixia.

The Marquis of Huaiyin led three hundred thousand and directly opposed them; General Kong was on the left, General Fei on the right, the Emperor behind, and Marquis of Jiang and General Chai behind the Emperor. Xiang Yu&#039;s troops numbered about a hundred thousand. Huaiyin first engaged, went unfavorably, and retreated. General Kong and General Fei were released; the Chu troops went unfavorably, and the Marquis of Huaiyin again rode upon them, greatly defeating them at Gaixia. Xiang Yu&#039;s troops heard the Han army&#039;s Chu songs and thought Han had completely obtained the lands of Chu; Xiang Yu was then defeated and fled; because of this the troops were greatly defeated. He sent cavalry general Guan Ying to pursue and kill Xiang Yu at Dongcheng, behead eighty thousand, and then take and settle the lands of Chu. Lu firmly defended for Chu and would not surrender. The King of Han led the feudal lords&#039; troops north and showed Xiang Yu&#039;s head to the fathers and elders of Lu; Lu then surrendered. They then buried Xiang Yu at Gucheng with the rites of Duke of Lu. Returning to reach Dingtao, he galloped into the King of Qi&#039;s encampment and seized his army.</div>

People asked why she cried; the old woman said: \"Someone killed my son, therefore I cry.\" People said: \"Why was your son killed?\" The old woman said: \"My son is the son of the White Emperor; he transformed into a snake and blocked the road; now he was beheaded by the son of the Red Emperor, therefore I cry.\" People thought the old woman was lying and wanted to punish her, but the old woman suddenly disappeared. When the people behind arrived, Gao Zu awoke. The people behind told Gao Zu; Gao Zu was secretly delighted in his heart and felt self-assured. Those who followed him grew daily more in awe of him.","translator":"Garrett M.

He held a banquet at Pei Palace, summoned all his old friends, fathers, elders, sons, and younger brothers to drink without restraint, and gathered one hundred twenty boys from Pei and taught them to sing. When the wine was flowing, Gao Zu struck the zhu and composed a song himself, saying: \"The great wind rises and clouds fly; authority extends over the seas and I return to my native place; where can I find brave men to defend the four quarters!\" He had the boys all harmonize and practice it. Gao Zu then rose to dance, impassioned and moved in feeling, weeping tears streaming down. He said to the fathers and elder brothers of Pei: \"A traveler grieves for his native place. Though I have made my capital in Guanzhong, after ten thousand years my spirit and soul will still delight in longing for Pei. Moreover, I from being Duke of Pei executed the violent and rebellious and consequently possessed all under Heaven; let Pei be my bathing estate, exempt its people, generation after generation never having to contribute anything.\" The fathers, elder brothers, mothers, and old friends of Pei daily delighted in drinking to extreme joy, recounting old times for laughter and pleasure. After over ten days, Gao Zu wished to leave; the fathers and elder brothers of Pei firmly requested Gao Zu to remain. Gao Zu said: \"My people are numerous; the fathers and elder brothers cannot provide for them.\" He then departed. The entire county of Pei went to the west of the township to present offerings. Gao Zu again remained and stopped, holding banquets and drinking for three days. The fathers and elder brothers of Pei all kowtowed and said: \"Pei has been fortunate to obtain exemption; Feng has not been exempted—we only hope Your Majesty will take pity on it.\" Gao Zu said: \"Feng is where I was born and grew up—I absolutely do not forget it; I particularly hold it against them that because of Yong Chi they rebelled against me for Wei.\" The fathers and elder brothers of Pei firmly requested; he then also exempted Feng, equal to Pei.
