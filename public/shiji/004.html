            <div class="chinese-text">周后稷，名棄。其母有邰氏女，曰姜原。姜原為帝嚳元妃。姜原出野，見巨人跡，心忻然說，欲踐之，踐之而身動如孕者。居期而生子，以為不祥，棄之隘巷，馬牛過者皆辟不踐；徙置之林中，適會山林多人，遷之；而棄渠中冰上，飛鳥以其翼覆薦之。姜原以為神，遂收養長之。初欲棄之，因名曰棄。</div>
            <div class="english-text">Zhou&#039;s Houji was named Qi (meaning &quot;Abandoned&quot;). His mother was a woman of the Youtai clan, named Jiang Yuan. Jiang Yuan was the principal consort of Emperor Ku. Jiang Yuan went out to the fields and saw a giant&#039;s footprint; her heart was delighted, and she wanted to step in it. When she stepped in it, her body stirred as if she were pregnant. After the full term she gave birth to a son; considering this inauspicious, she abandoned him in a narrow alley, but horses and oxen that passed all avoided him and did not trample him. She moved and placed him in the forest, but it happened that many people were in the mountains and forests, so she moved him again. Then she abandoned him on the ice in a ditch, but flying birds covered and protected him with their wings. Jiang Yuan considered this divine intervention, and thereupon took him in and raised him. Because she had initially wanted to abandon him, she named him Qi (&quot;Abandoned&quot;).</div>

            <div class="english-text">When Qi was a child, he was firm and resolute like a great man. In his play, he loved to plant hemp and beans, and the hemp and beans grew beautifully. When he became an adult, he came to love agriculture, examined the suitability of land, and planted crops where grain was suitable; the people all took him as their model. Emperor Yao heard of this and appointed Qi as Minister of Agriculture; all under Heaven benefited from this, and he had merit. Emperor Shun said: &quot;Qi, the common people were suffering from hunger; you, as Houji, sowed the various grains in their proper seasons.&quot;  He enfeoffed Qi at Tai, titled him Houji, and gave him the separate surname Ji. Houji&#039;s rise occurred during the time of Taotang (Yao), Yu (Shun), and Xia; all had excellent virtue.</div>

            <div class="english-text">When Houji died, his son Buzhu succeeded him. In Buzhu&#039;s final years, the government of the Xia declined; they abandoned the office of Ji and did not attend to it, so Buzhu lost his office and fled to live among the Rong and Di tribes. When Buzhu died, his son Ju succeeded him. When Ju died, his son Gongliu succeeded him. Although Gongliu was among the Rong and Di, he restored Houji&#039;s work, devoted himself to plowing and planting, practiced suitability of land, crossed the Wei River from the Qi and Ju rivers, obtained useful materials, so that travelers had provisions and residents had stored supplies, and the people relied on his blessings. The common people cherished him, and many migrated to seek refuge and return to him. The rise of the Zhou way began from this point, therefore poets sang joyfully in remembrance of his virtue. When Gongliu died, his son Qingjie succeeded him and established his state at Bin.</div>

When Huiyu died, his son Gongfei succeeded him. When Gongfei died, his son Gaoyu succeeded him. When Gaoyu died, his son Yayu succeeded him. When Yayu died, his son Gongshu Zulei succeeded him. When Gongshu Zulei died, his son Gugong Danfu succeeded him. Gugong Danfu again restored the work of Houji and Gongliu, accumulated virtue and practiced righteousness, and all the people of the state honored him. The Xunyu Rong and Di tribes attacked him, wanting to obtain wealth and goods, so he gave it to them. But they attacked again, wanting to obtain land and people. The people were all angry and wanted to fight. Gugong said: &quot;When the people establish a ruler, it is in order to benefit them. Now the Rong and Di attack and make war for my land and people. Whether the people are with me or with them, what difference does it make? If the people want to fight on my account, killing fathers and sons in order to have me as ruler, I cannot bear to do this.&quot;  Thereupon, with his close followers, he left Bin, crossed the Qi and Ju rivers, went over Mount Liang, and stopped at the foot of Mount Qi. The people of Bin, the entire state supporting the old and leading the young, all returned to Gugong at the foot of Mount Qi. When other neighboring states heard of Gugong&#039;s benevolence, many also came to him. Thereupon Gugong rejected the customs of the Rong and Di, constructed city walls and houses, and had people settle separately in towns. He established the five offices with their officials. The people all sang joyfully of him and praised his virtue.</div>

Taijiang gave birth to a youngest son, Jili; Jili married Tairen, both virtuous women, and they gave birth to Chang, who displayed sacred auspicious signs. Gugong said: &quot;Our lineage shall have one who brings prosperity; will it be in Chang?&quot;  The eldest sons Taibo and Yuzhong knew that Gugong wished to install Jili in order to transmit succession to Chang, so the two fled to the Jing and Man tribes, tattooed their bodies and cut their hair, thereby yielding to Jili.</div>

The Western Earl was called King Wen; he followed the work of Houji and Gongliu, modeled himself on the methods of Gugong and Gongji, was devoted to benevolence, revered the old, and showed kindness to the young. He treated worthy men with courtesy, had no leisure to eat at midday while receiving scholars, and scholars for this reason came to him in great numbers.

Hong Yao and his group were worried about this. So they sought beautiful women from the Youxin clan, patterned horses from the Lirong, nine teams of four horses from Youxiong, and other rare and strange objects, and through Yin&#039;s favorite minister Fei Zhong presented them to Zhou. Zhou was greatly pleased and said: &quot;Even one of these things would be enough to release the Western Earl, how much more so when there are many!&quot;  So he pardoned the Western Earl, bestowed upon him bows, arrows, axes, and halberds, and allowed the Western Earl to conduct punitive expeditions. He said: &quot;The one who slandered the Western Earl was Chonghou Hu.&quot;  The Western Earl then offered the land west of Luo, requesting that Zhou abolish the punishment of roasting on a bronze pillar. Zhou consented to this.</div>

He then proceeded inward and reached the place where Zhou had died. King Wu personally shot at him; after three arrows he descended from his chariot, struck him with a light sword, severed Zhou&#039;s head with a yellow battle-axe, and hung it on a great white banner. Then he came to Zhou&#039;s two favorite concubines; both women had hanged themselves. King Wu again shot three arrows, struck them with his sword, severed their heads with a black battle-axe, and hung them on a small white banner.

The Duke of Zhou, following King Cheng&#039;s command, attacked and executed Wugeng and Guan Shu, and exiled Cai Shu. He had Weizi Kai succeed as heir of Yin and established him in the state at Song.

            <div class="english-text">When King Mu was about to attack the Quanrong, Jigong Moufu remonstrated, saying: &quot;You cannot. The former kings displayed virtue, not military force. Military force should be restrained and only used at appropriate times; when used it inspires awe, when displayed it becomes familiar, and when familiar it loses its power to intimidate. Therefore the ode of Zhou Wengong says: &#039;We put away shields and spears, we sheathe bows and arrows, I seek beautiful virtue, spread it in the great Xia, and the king truly preserves it.&#039;  The former kings, in dealing with the people, cultivated and rectified their virtue and enriched their nature, multiplied their wealth and made their implements useful, clarified what was beneficial and harmful, cultivated them with civil culture, made them pursue benefit and avoid harm, cherish virtue and fear authority; therefore they were able to preserve their reigns and grow ever greater. In former times our ancestors for generations, from Houji onward, served Yu and Xia. When Xia declined, they abandoned the office of Ji and did not attend to it; our ancestor Buzhu thus lost his office and fled to hide among the Rong and Di. Not daring to neglect his duties, he continually cultivated his virtue, followed and maintained his heritage, cultivated his teachings and laws, morning and evening was respectfully diligent, guarded with sincerity and loyalty, and served with faithful devotion. Through successive generations they carried on virtue, not shaming their predecessors. When it came to King Wen and King Wu, they illuminated the brilliance of their predecessors and added to it compassion and harmony, served the spirits and protected the people, and all were joyful. King Di Xin of Shang greatly wronged the people; the common people could not bear it and joyfully supported King Wu, thereby bringing the army to the fields of Shang. Therefore the former kings did not pursue military affairs, but encouraged concern for the people&#039;s suffering and eliminated their harm. The former kings&#039; system was: within the state was the dian service zone, outside the state was the hou service zone, beyond the hou was the bin service zone, the Yi and Man were the yao service zone, and the Rong and Di were the huang service zone. The dian zone performed sacrifices, the hou zone performed ancestral offerings, the bin zone presented tributes, the yao zone brought contributions, and the huang zone acknowledged the king. Daily sacrifices, monthly offerings, seasonal presentations, yearly contributions, and lifelong acknowledgment of the king. In the former kings&#039; proper ritual system, if there were no sacrifices they cultivated goodwill, if no offerings they cultivated speech, if no presentations they cultivated civil culture, if no contributions they cultivated reputation, if no acknowledgment of the king they cultivated virtue, and only if the order was established and some still did not come did they apply punishments. Thus there was punishment for not sacrificing, attack for not offering, expedition for not presenting, admonishment for not contributing, and proclamation for not acknowledging the king. Thus there were criminal laws for punishment, military forces for attack, preparations for expeditions, commands of威 authority and admonishment, and proclamations in writing. If after issuing orders and making proclamations some still did not come, they would further cultivate virtue and not trouble the people with distant campaigns. Therefore those near all obeyed, and those far all submitted. Now since the end of Dabi and Boshi, the Quanrong have come to acknowledge the king with their duties, yet the Son of Heaven says &#039;I must attack them for not presenting tributes, and display military force to them&#039;; would this not abandon the teachings of the former kings and bring the king near to ruin? I have heard that the Quanrong are sincere and honest, follow ancient virtue, and remain purely steadfast; they will have the means to resist us.&quot;  The king nevertheless attacked them, obtained four white wolves and four white deer, and returned. From this time on, those in the huang service zone did not come.</div>

            <div class="english-text">When there were feudal lords who were not harmonious, Fu Hou spoke to the king and composed reforms to the criminal laws. The king said: &quot;Ah, come! You who have states and territories, I inform you of auspicious punishments. Now as you pacify the hundred clans, how can you choose the wrong people, how can you not respect proper punishments, how can you not dwell in what is appropriate? When both parties are present, the judge hears the five types of testimony. If the five testimonies are clear and trustworthy, apply the five punishments correctly. If the five punishments are not clear, apply the five fines correctly. If the five fines are not accepted, examine the five types of errors correctly. Regarding the defects of the five errors, in official prisons and inner prisons, examine their crimes truthfully, only weighing their errors equally. When the five punishments are doubtful grant pardon, when the five fines are doubtful grant pardon; examine and decide them carefully. Be clear and trustworthy with the multitude; only interrogate when there is something to investigate. Do not simplify what is doubtful; together uphold the stern majesty of Heaven. For tattooing punishment when doubtful grant pardon; the fine is one hundred units; examine the crime truthfully. For nose-cutting punishment when doubtful grant pardon; the fine is double that amount; examine the crime truthfully. For foot-amputation punishment when doubtful grant pardon; the fine is double the difference; examine the crime truthfully. For castration punishment when doubtful grant pardon; the fine is five hundred units; examine the crime truthfully. For capital punishment when doubtful grant pardon; the fine is one thousand units; examine the crime truthfully. The categories under tattooing punishment are one thousand, the categories under nose-cutting punishment are one thousand, the categories under foot-amputation punishment are five hundred, the categories under castration punishment are three hundred, the categories under capital punishment are two hundred: the five punishments have three thousand categories in all.&quot;  This was called the Fu Code.</div>

Now profit is what the hundred things arise from, what heaven and earth sustain; to monopolize it brings much harm. All things of heaven and earth will seek to take from it; how can it be monopolized? Those angered will be very many, and he is not prepared for great calamity. To teach the king with this—can the king last long? One who rules over people should guide profit and distribute it to high and low. Enabling spirits, people, and all things to attain their utmost, yet still daily being anxious and fearful that resentment will come. Therefore the Odes say: &#039;Admirable Houji, able to match Heaven, established our multitudes, none failed to reach their utmost.&#039; The Greater Odes say: &#039;Displayed gifts sustained Zhou.&#039; Thus they distributed profit while fearing calamity, therefore they were able to sustain Zhou up to now.

King Li was pleased and told the Duke of Shao: &quot;I can stop slander now; they dare not speak.&quot;  The Duke of Shao said: &quot;This is blocking them. Blocking the mouths of the people is worse than blocking water. When water is dammed up and bursts through, it will surely harm many people; the people are also like this. Therefore those who manage water open channels to guide it, and those who govern people allow them to speak freely. Therefore when the Son of Heaven attended to government, he had dukes and ministers down to ranked officials present poems, blind musicians present songs, scribes present writings, preceptors offer admonitions, blind men recite, sightless men chant, artisans remonstrate, common people relay words, close ministers exhaust their counsel, relatives supplemented observations, blind musicians and historians taught and instructed, and the elderly revised them; only then did the king deliberate; thus affairs proceeded without error. The people having mouths is like the land having mountains and rivers, from which wealth and resources come forth; it is like having plains, lowlands, marshes, and fertile fields, from which clothing and food arise. When mouths proclaim words, from this arise both good and bad. To practice good and prepare against failure is how wealth, resources, clothing, and food are produced. The people consider in their hearts and proclaim with their mouths, then accomplish and act upon it. If you block their mouths, how long can it last?&quot;  The king did not listen. Thereupon no one in the state dared speak out; after three years, they revolted together and attacked King Li. King Li fled to Zhi.</div>

Now if they kill the crown prince, will the king consider me his enemy and hate me with anger?

            <div class="english-text">In the forty-sixth year, King Xuan died; his son King You Gongnie succeeded him. In the second year of King You, the three rivers of Western Zhou all experienced earthquakes. Boyang Fu said: &quot;Zhou will perish. The qi of Heaven and Earth do not lose their proper order; if they exceed their order, it is because the people have thrown them into disorder. When yang is suppressed and cannot emerge, and yin presses down and cannot rise, then there are earthquakes. Now the three rivers have truly experienced earthquakes; this means yang has lost its position and is overwhelmed by yin. When yang is lost and buried in yin, springs will surely be blocked; when springs are blocked, the state will surely perish. Water and soil flowing freely is what the people depend on. When the soil has no flow, the people will lack wealth and resources; if not perishing, what are we waiting for! In the past, the Yi and Luo dried up and Xia perished, the Yellow River dried up and Shang perished. Now Zhou&#039;s virtue is like that of the last years of those two dynasties; its rivers and springs are moreover blocked, and being blocked they will surely dry up. A state must depend on mountains and rivers; when mountains collapse and rivers dry up, these are signs of a perishing state. When rivers dry up, mountains will surely collapse. If the state perishes, it will be no more than ten years, which is one cycle of numbers. What Heaven abandons does not exceed its cycle.&quot;  In that year, the three rivers dried up and Mount Qi collapsed.</div>

            <div class="english-text">In the third year, King You doted on and loved Bao Si. Bao Si gave birth to a son, Bofu, and King You wanted to depose the crown prince. The crown prince&#039;s mother was a daughter of the Marquis of Shen and had become queen. Later when King You obtained Bao Si, he loved her and wanted to depose Queen Shen, also removing Crown Prince Yijiu, making Bao Si the queen and Bofu the crown prince. The Grand Historian of Zhou, Boyang, read the historical records and said: &quot;Zhou will perish.&quot;  Long ago when the Xia declined, two divine dragons appeared in the court of the Xia emperor and said: &#039;We are the two lords of Bao.&#039;  The Xia emperor divined whether to kill them, drive them away, or keep them; none was auspicious. He divined about requesting their saliva and storing it; this was auspicious. Thereupon he presented ritual gifts and made an announcement with divination tablets; the dragons disappeared but the saliva remained, and he put it in a box and stored it away. When Xia perished, this vessel was transmitted to Yin. When Yin perished, this vessel was again transmitted to Zhou. Throughout all three dynasties, none dared to open it; until the end of King Li&#039;s reign, when it was opened and examined. The saliva flowed in the courtyard and could not be removed. King Li had women strip naked and shout at it. The saliva transformed into a black turtle and entered the king&#039;s rear palace. A young maid in the rear palace encountered it when she had lost her baby teeth, became pregnant when she came of age, and gave birth to a child without a husband; frightened, she abandoned it. In King Xuan&#039;s time, young girls sang a ditty: &#039;A bow of wild mulberry and quiver of wicker will truly destroy the Zhou state.&#039;  When King Xuan heard this, there was a couple selling such implements, and King Xuan had them arrested and executed. They fled on the road and saw the ominous child that had been abandoned by the rear palace maid lying on the road; hearing her cry at night, they pitied her and took her in, and the couple then escaped and fled to Bao. The people of Bao committed a crime and requested to present the girl abandoned by the maid to the king to redeem their crime. The abandoned girl came from Bao; this was Bao Si. In King You&#039;s third year, when the king&#039;s rear palace saw her, he loved her; she gave birth to a son Bofu, and he finally deposed Queen Shen and the crown prince, making Bao Si the queen and Bofu the crown prince. Grand Historian Boyang said: &quot;The disaster is complete; there is nothing that can be done!&quot;</div>

But the envoy has already departed.&quot;  Dai said: &quot;Why not give Gaodu to Zhou?&quot;  The prime minister of Han became very angry and said: &quot;That I do not requisition armor and grain from Zhou is already generous; why would I give Gaodu to Zhou?&quot;  Dai said: &quot;To give Gaodu to Zhou means Zhou will be bent and submit to Han; when Qin hears of this they will surely be greatly angered at Zhou and will then not communicate with Zhou&#039;s envoys; this way you give up a weakened Gaodu and obtain an intact Zhou. Why not give it?&quot;  The prime minister said: &quot;Good.&quot;  Indeed, he gave Gaodu to Zhou.</div>

            <div class="english-text">In the thirty-fourth year, Su Li said to the lord of Zhou: &quot;That Qin defeated Han and Wei, destroyed the army at Shiwu, and took Lin and Lishi from Zhao in the north was all due to Bai Qi. He is skilled at using troops and also has Heaven&#039;s mandate. Now he is about to lead troops out of the passes to attack Liang; if Liang is broken, Zhou will be in danger. Why don&#039;t you have someone persuade Bai Qi? Say: &#039;Chu had Yang Youji, who was an excellent archer. At a hundred paces from willow leaves he shot at them, and out of a hundred shots hit every one. Several thousand observers on both sides all said he was an excellent archer. There was one man standing beside him who said: &#039;Good, but you can still be taught archery.&#039; Yang Youji became angry, put down his bow, grasped his sword, and said: &#039;How can you, guest, teach me archery?&#039; The guest said: &#039;It is not that I can teach you to extend left and bend right. At a hundred paces from willow leaves you shoot at them, and out of a hundred shots hit every one; if you do not rest when you are shooting well, soon your energy will decline and strength weaken, the bow will be deflected and arrows will hook; if one shot misses, all hundred shots will be wasted.&#039; Now that you have defeated Han and Wei, destroyed the army at Shiwu, and taken Lin and Lishi from Zhao in the north, your merits are many. Now you are about to lead troops out of the passes, pass through the Two Zhous, turn your back on Han, and attack Liang; if one campaign fails, all previous achievements will be abandoned. You would be better off claiming illness and not going out.&#039;&quot;</div>

He also said to the King of Liang: &quot;The King of Zhou is very ill; Fan requests to wait until later when it is feasible and report back. Now that you have sent troops to Zhou, all the feudal lords have become suspicious, and later when you undertake matters they will not trust you. It would be better to have the troops fortify Zhou, to conceal the true intention.&quot;  The King of Liang said: &quot;Good.&quot;  He then had them fortify Zhou.</div>
