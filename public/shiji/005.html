            <div class="english-text">The ancestors of Qin were descendants of Emperor Zhuanxu, and a descendant named Nüxiu. While Nüxiu was weaving, a dark bird dropped an egg, which Nüxiu swallowed and gave birth to a son named Daye. Daye married a daughter of Shaodian, named Nühua. Nühua gave birth to Dafei, who helped Yu control the floods. When the work was complete, the Emperor bestowed a dark jade tablet. Yu received it and said: &#039;It was not I alone who accomplished this; Dafei assisted me.&#039; Emperor Shun said: &#039;Ah, you Fei, you assisted Yu&#039;s work, and I bestow upon you a black pennant. Your descendants shall greatly flourish.&#039; He then gave him a beautiful woman of the Yao surname as wife. Dafei bowed and accepted, and assisted Shun in taming birds and beasts. Many birds and beasts became tame, and he was called Boyi. Shun bestowed upon him the surname Ying.</div>

            <div class="english-text">Dafei had two sons: the first was Dalian, who founded the Niaoshu clan; the second was Ruomu, who founded the Fei clan. His great-great-grandson was Feichang, whose descendants lived either in the Central States or among the barbarians. Feichang, during the reign of Jie of Xia, left Xia and joined Shang, becoming Tang&#039;s charioteer and defeating Jie at Mingtiao. Dalian&#039;s great-great-grandson was named Mengxi and Zhongyan, who had bird-like bodies but spoke like humans. Emperor Taiwu heard of this and divined whether to employ him as a charioteer. The divination was auspicious, so he made him a charioteer and gave him a wife. From Taiwu onward, the descendants of Zhongyan continued to achieve merit, assisting the Yin state, so the Ying surname became prominent and they became feudal lords.</div>

            <div class="english-text">His great-great-grandson was Zhongjue, who lived among the Western Rong and protected the western frontier. He fathered Feilian. Feilian fathered Elai. Elai was strong, and Feilian was a swift runner; father and son both served Yin Zhou with their abilities. When King Wu of Zhou attacked Zhou, he also killed Elai. At that time, Feilian was seeking stone for Zhou in the north. When he returned, having nowhere to report, he built an altar at Mount Huotai to make his report, and found a stone coffin with an inscription reading: &#039;The Emperor commands Chufu not to participate in Yin&#039;s chaos, and bestows upon you this stone coffin to honor the Hua clan.&#039; When he died, he was buried at Mount Huotai. Feilian had another son named Jisheng. Jisheng fathered Mengzeng. Mengzeng was favored by King Cheng of Zhou, and was called &#039;Dwelling at Gaolang.&#039; Gaolang fathered Hengfu, and Hengfu fathered Zaofu. Zaofu was favored by King Mu of Zhou for his excellent charioteering, and obtained the four horses Ji, Wenli, Hualiu, and Lu&#039;er. They went on a western inspection tour, enjoying themselves so much they forgot to return. When Xu Yanwang rebelled, Zaofu served as King Mu&#039;s charioteer, driving swiftly back to Zhou, covering a thousand li in one day to suppress the rebellion. King Mu enfeoffed Zaofu with the city of Zhao, and Zaofu&#039;s clan thereafter took the surname Zhao. From Feilian&#039;s son Jisheng down five generations to Zaofu, they separately resided in Zhao. Zhao Cui was his descendant. Elai Ge, son of Feilian, died young. He had a son named Nüfang. Nüfang fathered Panggao, Panggao fathered Taiji, Taiji fathered Daluo, and Daluo fathered Feizi. Because of Zaofu&#039;s favor, they all received the city of Zhao and took the surname Zhao.</div>

            <div class="english-text">Feizi lived at Quanqiu, where he loved horses and livestock and was skilled at raising them. The people of Quanqiu reported this to King Xiao of Zhou, who summoned him to manage horses between the Qian and Wei rivers, and the horses multiplied greatly. King Xiao wished to make him the legitimate heir of Daluo. The daughter of the Marquis of Shen was Daluo&#039;s wife, and she bore a son Cheng as the legitimate heir. The Marquis of Shen then said to King Xiao: &#039;Formerly, my ancestress, a woman of Mount Li, was wife to Rong Xuxuan and bore Zhongjue. Because of this kinship, they returned to Zhou and protected the western frontier, and the western frontier was peaceful because of this. Now I have again given a wife to Daluo, who bore the legitimate son Cheng. With the intermarriage of Shen and Luo, all the Western Rong submit; this is why you are king. Your Majesty should consider this.&#039; King Xiao then said: &#039;Formerly, Boyi was Shun&#039;s master of livestock, and the livestock multiplied greatly, so he received land and was granted the surname Ying. Now his descendants also raise horses for me, so I shall grant them territory as a dependent state.&#039; He established them at Qin, allowing them to continue the sacrifices of the Ying clan, and called them Qin Ying. He also did not abolish the son of the Marquis of Shen&#039;s daughter as Luo&#039;s legitimate heir, in order to maintain peace with the Western Rong.</div>

            <div class="english-text">In the third year of Qin Zhong&#039;s reign, King Li of Zhou was tyrannical, and some feudal lords rebelled against him. The Western Rong rebelled against the royal house and exterminated the Daluo clan at Quanqiu. When King Xuan of Zhou ascended the throne, he made Qin Zhong a grand master and ordered him to punish the Western Rong. The Western Rong killed Qin Zhong. Qin Zhong had reigned for twenty-three years when he died at the hands of the Rong. He had five sons, the eldest of whom was Duke Zhuang. King Xuan of Zhou summoned Duke Zhuang and his four brothers, gave them seven thousand soldiers, and ordered them to attack the Western Rong. They defeated them. Thereupon, he restored to Qin Zhong&#039;s descendants the lands of their ancestor Daluo at Quanqiu, and made them Grand Masters of the Western Frontier.</div>

            <div class="english-text">Duke Zhuang resided at the former Western Quanqiu and had three sons, the eldest being Shifu. Shifu said: &#039;The Rong killed my grandfather Zhong. Unless I kill the Rong king, I will not dare enter the town.&#039; He then went to attack the Rong, yielding the succession to his younger brother Duke Xiang. Duke Xiang became heir apparent. Duke Zhuang reigned for forty-four years and died. His heir, Duke Xiang, succeeded him. In the first year of Duke Xiang&#039;s reign, he gave his younger sister Mu Ying in marriage to the king of Feng. In the second year of Duke Xiang&#039;s reign, the Rong besieged Quanqiu. Shifu attacked them but was captured by the Rong. After more than a year, Shifu was returned. In the seventh year, in spring, King You of Zhou used Baosi to depose the heir apparent and made Baosi&#039;s son the legitimate heir. He repeatedly deceived the feudal lords, and the feudal lords rebelled against him. The Western Rong and the Quanrong, together with the Marquis of Shen, attacked Zhou and killed King You below Mount Li. Duke Xiang of Qin led troops to rescue Zhou, fought valiantly, and achieved merit. Zhou fled from the Quanrong threat and moved east to Luoyi. Duke Xiang escorted King Ping of Zhou with his troops. King Ping enfeoffed Duke Xiang as a feudal lord and granted him the lands west of Qi. He said: &#039;The Rong are lawless and have invaded and seized our lands of Qi and Feng. If Qin can attack and drive out the Rong, the land shall be yours.&#039; He made a covenant with him and enfeoffed him with noble rank. Thus Duke Xiang first established a state. He exchanged diplomatic courtesies with the other feudal lords, and offered sacrifices to the Supreme Deity at the Western Altar using three each of bay colts, yellow oxen, and rams. In the twelfth year, he attacked the Rong and reached Qi, where he died. He fathered Duke Wen.</div>

Jian Shu is worthy, but the world does not know him. I once wandered in poverty in Qi and begged for food in Zhi. Jian Shu took me in. Because of this, I wanted to serve the ruler of Qi, Wuzhi, but Jian Shu stopped me, and I escaped the troubles in Qi and went to Zhou. The Zhou prince Tui loved cattle, and I approached him through raising cattle. When Tui was about to employ me, Jian Shu stopped me; I left and avoided being executed. When I served the ruler of Yu, Jian Shu stopped me. I knew the ruler of Yu would not employ me, but I was truly covetous of the salary and rank, so I stayed. Twice I followed his advice and escaped; once I did not follow it, and I was caught up in Yu&#039;s troubles. This is how I know he is worthy.&#039; Duke Mu then sent someone with generous gifts to invite Jian Shu, and made him a Senior Grand Master.</div>

            <div class="english-text">In the fourteenth year, Qin had a famine and requested grain from Jin. The ruler of Jin consulted his ministers. Guo She said: &#039;Attack them while they are starving, and you can achieve great merit.&#039; The ruler of Jin followed this advice. In the fifteenth year, he raised troops to attack Qin. Duke Mu mobilized his forces, sent Pi Bao as general, and went himself to attack them. On the renxu day of the ninth month, he joined battle with Duke Hui of Jin, Yiwu, at Han. The ruler of Jin abandoned his army and competed with Qin for advantage; as he turned back, his horse stumbled. Duke Mu and his bodyguards rode in pursuit, but could not catch the ruler of Jin, and were instead surrounded by the Jin army. Jin attacked Duke Mu, and Duke Mu was wounded. At that moment, three hundred men from below Mount Qi who had eaten his good horses charged through the Jin army. The Jin army broke their encirclement, and they rescued Duke Mu and in turn captured the ruler of Jin alive. Earlier, Duke Mu had lost some fine horses, and more than three hundred commoners below Mount Qi had caught and eaten them together. Officials tracked them down and wanted to punish them according to law. Duke Mu said: &#039;A gentleman does not harm people for the sake of livestock. I have heard that eating good horse meat without drinking wine harms a person.&#039; So he gave them all wine and pardoned them. When the three hundred men heard that Qin was attacking Jin, they all sought to join the campaign. When they saw Duke Mu in distress, they all charged forward and vied to die for him, to repay his kindness in the matter of the horses. Duke Mu then brought the captured ruler of Jin home and issued an order throughout the state that they should purify themselves, for he would sacrifice the ruler of Jin to the Supreme Deity. When the Zhou Son of Heaven heard this, he said, &#039;Jin is of the same surname as us,&#039; and requested the release of the ruler of Jin. Yiwu&#039;s elder sister was also Duke Mu&#039;s wife. When she heard this, she put on mourning clothes, went barefoot, and said: &#039;My brother and I cannot save each other, and thus we have disgraced your command.&#039; Duke Mu said: &#039;I captured the ruler of Jin as an achievement, but now the Son of Heaven requests his release, and my wife is distressed.&#039; So he made a covenant with the ruler of Jin, agreed to return him, moved him to better quarters, and presented him with seven sets of sacrificial animals. In the eleventh month, he returned the ruler of Jin, Yiwu. Yiwu ceded his lands west of the river and sent his heir apparent Yu as a hostage to Qin. Qin gave a woman of the royal clan in marriage to Yu. At this time, Qin&#039;s territory extended east to the Yellow River.</div>

In the twenty-third year, Duke Hui of Jin died, and Yu was established as ruler. Qin resented Yu for fleeing, so they welcomed Prince Chong&#039;er of Jin from Chu and gave him Yu&#039;s former wife in marriage. Chong&#039;er at first declined, but later accepted. Duke Mu treated him with ever greater courtesy and generosity. In the spring of the twenty-fourth year, Qin sent someone to tell the ministers of Jin that they wished to install Chong&#039;er. Jin agreed, and so they sent someone to escort Chong&#039;er. In the second month, Chong&#039;er was established as ruler of Jin; this was Duke Wen. Duke Wen had someone kill Yu. Yu was known as Duke Huai.</div>

            <div class="english-text">A man from Zheng came to sell out Zheng to Qin, saying: &#039;I am in charge of the city gates; Zheng can be taken by surprise.&#039; Duke Mu asked Jian Shu and Baili Xi, who replied: &#039;To travel a thousand li through several states to attack someone by surprise rarely succeeds. Moreover, if someone is selling out Zheng, how do we know that someone from our own state will not inform Zheng of our plans? This cannot be done.&#039; Duke Mu said: &#039;You do not understand; I have already decided.&#039; So he dispatched troops, sending Baili Xi&#039;s son Mengming Shi, Jian Shu&#039;s son Xi Qishu, and Bai Yibing to lead the army. On the day they departed, Baili Xi and Jian Shu wept for them. Duke Mu heard of this and angrily said: &#039;I dispatch troops and you weep to demoralize my army; why?&#039; The two elders said: &#039;We would not dare to demoralize your army. The army marches, and our sons go with it; we are old, and fear we will not live to see their return, so we weep.&#039; The two elders withdrew and said to their sons: &#039;When your army is defeated, it will certainly be at the Xiao Pass.&#039; In the spring of the thirty-third year, the Qin army marched east, crossed Jin territory, and passed by the north gate of Zhou. Prince Man of Zhou said: &#039;The Qin army is disrespectful; what else can they expect but defeat!&#039; When the army reached Hua, a Zheng merchant named Xian Gao, who was taking twelve oxen to sell in Zhou, saw the Qin army. Fearing he would be killed or captured, he presented his oxen, saying: &#039;I have heard that a great power is coming to punish Zheng. The ruler of Zheng is carefully preparing his defenses, and has sent me with twelve oxen to reward the soldiers.&#039; The three Qin generals said to each other: &#039;We were going to surprise Zheng, but now Zheng is aware of it; there is no point in going.&#039; They destroyed Hua.

            <div class="english-text">The king of the Rong sent You Yu to Qin. You Yu&#039;s ancestors were people of Jin who had fled to the Rong, and he could speak the Jin language. Hearing that Duke Mu was worthy, he sent You Yu to observe Qin. Duke Mu of Qin showed him the palaces and storehouses. You Yu said: &#039;If spirits made these, then the spirits have been wearied. If men made these, then the people have been oppressed.&#039; Duke Mu was surprised and asked: &#039;The Central States use the Odes, Documents, rites, music, and laws to govern, yet they still have disorder from time to time. Now the Rong and Yi have none of these; how do they govern? Is it not difficult?&#039; You Yu laughed and said: &#039;This is precisely why the Central States are in disorder. From the time when the sage Huangdi created rites, music, and laws, and practiced them himself, there was barely minor order. By subsequent generations, they became daily more arrogant and dissolute. They relied on the authority of laws to demand service from their subordinates. When the subordinates were exhausted, they resented the superiors on grounds of humanity and righteousness. Superiors and subordinates fought and resented each other, leading to usurpation and regicide until whole clans were exterminated. All such cases belong to this pattern. The Rong and Yi are not like this. Superiors embrace simple virtue in treating their subordinates; subordinates cherish loyalty and trust in serving their superiors. The government of the whole state is like the governance of one body. They do not know by what means they govern; this is truly the government of sages.&#039; Duke Mu withdrew and asked the Palace Scribe Liao: &#039;I have heard that when a neighboring state has a sage, it is a worry for rival states. Now You Yu is worthy; he is a threat to me. What shall I do about it?&#039; Palace Scribe Liao said: &#039;The Rong king dwells in a remote place and has not heard the sounds of the Central States. Try sending him female musicians to beguile his mind; request You Yu for him, to create a rift between them; detain him and do not send him back, so that he misses his deadline. The Rong king will find this strange and will certainly suspect You Yu. When there is a rift between ruler and minister, he can be captured. Moreover, if the Rong king loves music, he will certainly neglect government.&#039; Duke Mu said: &#039;Good.&#039; He then sat with You Yu on adjacent mats, shared dishes with him, and inquired thoroughly about the terrain and military situation. Afterward, he had Palace Scribe Liao send sixteen female musicians to the Rong king. The Rong king accepted them and was delighted; he did not return for a whole year. Qin then sent You Yu back. You Yu remonstrated several times but was not heeded. Duke Mu also sent people several times to secretly invite You Yu, and You Yu eventually defected to Qin. Duke Mu treated him with the courtesy due a guest and asked him about the situation for attacking the Rong.</div>

            <div class="english-text">In the first year of Duke Xiao, there were six powerful states east of the mountains and rivers: Duke Wei of Qi, King Xuan of Chu, King Hui of Wei, Duke Dao of Yan, Marquis Ai of Han, and Marquis Cheng of Zhao were contemporaries. There were more than ten small states between the Huai and Si rivers. Chu and Wei shared borders with Qin. Wei built a long wall, from Zheng along the Luo River northward, possessing Shangjun. Chu extended from Hanzhong, with Ba and Qianzhong in the south. The Zhou royal house was weak, and the feudal lords governed by force, competing to annex each other. Qin was remote in Yongzhou, excluded from the meetings and covenants of the Central States&#039; feudal lords, and treated like the Yi and Di barbarians. Duke Xiao therefore spread benevolence, supported orphans and widows, recruited warriors, and made clear the rewards for merit. He issued an order throughout the state: &#039;Formerly, our Duke Mu, between Qi and Yong, cultivated virtue and practiced warfare, pacified Jin&#039;s troubles in the east using the river as boundary, became hegemon over the Rong and Di in the west, expanded territory by a thousand li, was honored by the Son of Heaven as hegemon, was congratulated by all the feudal lords, and opened a glorious and beautiful enterprise for later generations. It happened that in the past, under Duke Li, Duke Zao, Duke Jian, and Chuzi, there was no peace. The state had internal troubles and had no leisure for external affairs. The Three Jin attacked and seized our former rulers&#039; lands west of the river. The feudal lords despise Qin; no humiliation is greater than this. When Duke Xian ascended the throne, he pacified the borders, moved the capital to Liyang, and intended to campaign eastward to recover Duke Mu&#039;s former territories and restore Duke Mu&#039;s government. I, the lonely one, thinking of our former rulers&#039; intentions, am constantly pained in my heart. If any guest or minister can devise an extraordinary plan to strengthen Qin, I will give him high office and share my territory with him.&#039; Thereupon he sent troops east to besiege Shan city and west to behead the Huan king of the Rong.</div>

            <div class="english-text">Duke Xiao died; his son King Huiwen succeeded him. That year, Wei Yang was executed. When Wei Yang first implemented the laws in Qin, the laws were not being followed because the heir apparent had violated the prohibitions. Wei Yang said: &#039;The reason the laws are not being followed is that transgressions begin with the nobility. If your lordship truly wishes to implement the laws, begin with the heir apparent. The heir apparent cannot be branded, so brand his tutors.&#039; From then on the laws were greatly enforced, and the people of Qin were well governed. When Duke Xiao died and the heir apparent succeeded, many of the royal clan resented Wei Yang. Wei Yang fled, and they used this as evidence of rebellion. He was ultimately torn apart by chariots and displayed throughout Qin.</div>

Thereupon Qin sent General Jiu to attack Western Zhou. The Lord of Western Zhou came running to surrender, prostrating himself and confessing his crimes, offering all his thirty-six towns with thirty thousand inhabitants. The King of Qin accepted the surrender and returned the lord to Zhou. In the fifty-second year, the people of Zhou fled eastward, and the Nine Tripods entered Qin. Zhou was first destroyed.</div>
