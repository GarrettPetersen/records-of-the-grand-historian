Whenever Gaozu bought wine to drink, the tavern keeper charged him several times the amount. When they saw that he was unusual, at the end of each year these two families would tear up the debt contracts and forgive his obligations. Gaozu was puzzled by this and asked, 'Why do you do this?' The two families said, 'How can you speak so ignorantly! When the elders give a thousand pieces of gold, their descendants multiply; you wear silk clothes and buy official ranks—how can you speak so ignorantly!' Gaozu was broad-minded and magnanimous; hearing this, he was immediately pleased, realizing that few understood him. Gaozu often traveled the corvée road to Xianyang, stopping at the pavilion chief's station at Ba Terrace. The pavilion chief had a wife with attendants; getting drunk on wine, they traveled at night through the marshes, going through the marshes. He ordered one person to go ahead; the one who went ahead returned and reported: 'There is a large snake blocking the path ahead; I wish to turn back.' Gaozu was drunk and said, 'A brave man walks forward—what is there to fear!' He went forward, drew his sword, and struck down the snake, splitting it into two parts along the path. He walked along the path to where the snake had been and lay down drunk. Later, people came to where the snake was, and there was an old woman crying at night. People asked why she was crying; the old woman said, 'Someone killed my son, so I cry for him.' The people said, 'Old woman's son, why was he killed?' The old woman said, 'My son is the son of the White Emperor; he transformed into a snake to block the path, but now he has been slain by the son of the Red Emperor, so I cry.'
