When the local notables and officials in Pei heard that the magistrate had an important guest, they all came to offer congratulations. Xiao He, the chief clerk overseeing the reception, instructed the guests: 'Anyone who brings less than a thousand cash in congratulations should be seated below in the courtyard.' Gaozu, being a mere pavilion chief, was accustomed to treating officials casually. He forged a calling card claiming 'ten thousand cash in congratulations,' but brought nothing at all. When the calling card was presented, Lu Gong was astonished. He rose and went out to welcome him at the gate. Lu Gong was an expert in reading faces. When he saw Gaozu's features, he was filled with respect and seated him in the place of honor. Xiao He said, 'Liu Ji talks big but gets little done.' Gaozu casually mocked the other guests and took the seat of honor without any deference. As the banquet wound down, Lu Gong gave meaningful glances and insisted on keeping Gaozu behind. After the banquet concluded. Lu Gong said, 'Since youth I've loved reading faces. I've seen many people, but none with features like yours, Liu Ji. I hope you'll take good care of yourself.' 'I have a daughter of marriageable age whom I would like to offer as your wife.' After the banquet, Lady Lu angrily confronted her husband: 'You always said this daughter was special and deserved to marry someone noble.' 'The magistrate of Pei is your good friend. He asked for her hand and you refused. Why arbitrarily promise her to Liu Ji?' Lu Gong replied, 'This is beyond the understanding of women and children.' In the end, she was married to Emperor Gaozu.
