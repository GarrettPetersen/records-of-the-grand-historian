          "literal": "The ministers then dispatched envoys to welcome the King of Dai. Palace Attendant Commander Zhang Wu and others discussed the matter and all declared: 'The Han ministers are all veteran generals from Emperor Gao's time, experienced in military affairs and skilled in intrigue. Their ambitions extend beyond this—they were merely intimidated by the authority of Emperor Gao and Empress Lü.' Now that the Lü clan has been executed and blood still stains the capital streets, they come under the pretense of welcoming Your Majesty, but their intentions cannot be trusted. I advise feigning illness and not going, so we may observe how events develop.' Guard Commander Song Chang stepped forward and said: 'All the ministers' discussions are mistaken.' When Qin lost its governance, the regional lords and heroes rose up together. The Han king was the first to gain the empire because of his generosity, benevolence, love of ritual, and willingness to accept remonstrance without resentment. Thus the hearts of the people turned to him. Now the empire has just been pacified. Although there are great meritorious ministers, they are distant from the people's hearts. All believe they cannot match the generous benevolence and frugal modesty of Emperor Xiaohui, and that even with the strictness of Empress Lü, they could not approach the virtue of Emperor Wen. Now even if the ministers wished to rebel, the common people would not follow them. Could their faction possibly unite as one? The common people are the foundation of the regional lords. When sending envoys with commands throughout the realm, there should be no seizing or interference. Now the ministers, in punishing the Lü clan's crimes, have executed entire clans and caused arrows to fly wildly. When heaven's punishment is applied, there must be injustice involved. Moreover, the imperial carriage and great procession remain at the border regions. I wish to offer my foolish loyalty in performing my duties. If you do not follow this advice, I request to die in remonstrance before your corpse. Thereupon Zhang Wu and the others all declared: 'The chancellor's proposal cannot be used.' They then obeyed the imperial command and went with Feng Jing, uncle of the King of Huainan, to the Dai residence. By imperial command, Song Chang was summoned to ride in the carriage, while Zhang Wu and five others followed by relay post. Upon reaching Chang'an, the assembled ministers greeted them in their ranks. When Qin lost its governance, heroes arose together. Each person considered themselves capable of gaining the throne, numbering in the tens of thousands. Yet in the end, it was the Liu clan who ascended the imperial throne. The realm had despaired—this was the first reason. Emperor Gao's sons and younger brothers held territories that interlocked like dog's teeth, mutually restraining each other. This was called a lineage as solid as rock. The realm submitted to its strength—this was the second reason. When Han arose, it eliminated Qin's troublesome harshness, simplified the laws and commands, and extended benevolent favor. Each person felt secure and was difficult to shake—this was the third reason. Now the power of the realm lies with Your Majesty. No one can speak against it. Even with the dignity of an Empress Dowager, if she were to divide territories and enfeoff them, they would still be taken away. I hope Your Majesty will not fear them. Quickly lead troops to the Dai residence and take command of the Huaiyin Marquis's forces to secure the capital. Even if there is unrest, I wish to die together with the ministers. Thereupon Emperor Wen that very night drove into Weiyang Palace and met with the Empress Dowager, fully explaining the situation. Thereupon he issued an edict to Chancellor Chen Ping and Grand Commandant Zhou Bo: 'Now that I have ascended the imperial throne, what I value most in the realm is that I have no doubts regarding the Chancellor and Grand Commandant.' If there are any matters that do not go as intended, I rely on the Chancellor and Grand Commandant to handle them.'",

He completely abolished the laws and commands regarding collective punishment for confiscating property. In summer, fourth month, he granted amnesty to the realm. In the sixth month, amnesty was granted to the realm. In autumn, ninth month, amnesty was granted to the realm. In the second year, tenth month, Chancellor Chen Ping passed away.

They contributed tribute at the proper times, the people were not wearied, superiors and inferiors lived in harmony. I greatly approve of this.' Now the marquises mostly reside in Chang'an. Their fiefs are distant, and the officials and soldiers suffer from the costs of transporting supplies. Moreover, the marquises have no way to instruct their people.' Order the marquises to return to their countries. For those retained by official position or imperial command, send their heirs.' On the last day of the eleventh month, there was a solar eclipse. An edict declared: 'I have heard that Heaven gives birth to the people and establishes rulers to nurture and govern them.' If the ruler lacks virtue and governance is uneven, Heaven shows disasters to warn of poor governance.' Now on the last day of the eleventh month, there was a solar eclipse. I am greatly fearful.' Order all officials and people of the realm to consider the blame for this solar eclipse to rest on me alone.' Grant great amnesty to the realm.' In spring, first month, ding-hai day, an edict declared: 'Agriculture is the great foundation of the realm, that upon which the people depend for life. Yet some people neglect this foundation and pursue secondary occupations, so life is not fulfilled.' I urge agricultural affairs and personally plow to encourage the people.' This year I will personally plow the ritual field. Regional kings, dukes, marquises who have newly received their fiefs, those with merit and virtue, generals and sons of generals below the rank of general, illegitimate sons, officials of 2000 shi, imperial clansmen and sons of kings, sons of dukes and ministers must not walk in the imperial roadways.' In summer, fourth month, wu-xu day, an edict declared: 'I have obtained protection of the ancestral temple. With my insignificant person entrusted above the scholars, people, lords, and kings, if the realm is well governed then I am honored; if chaotic then I am to blame.' Now the realm is greatly at peace, the people harmonious and happy—this is all due to my good fortune.' Yet my officials may be unclear, laws harsh and officials cruel. Among resentful people and sorrowful officials, this is hardly the way of governance.' Therefore I wish to reform the laws, carefully select officials, and lighten punishments, so that fathers and sons, brothers and relatives may remain together for a long time without separation.' The officials firmly requested: 'In ancient times, Yin and Zhou possessed their states. Their peaceful governance lasted nearly a thousand years each. None who possessed the realm lasted longer than this. They used this way.' Establishing an heir must be a son—this principle comes from long ago.'",

The blame for both situations comes from my thin virtue that cannot reach far.' In recent years, the Xiongnu have together violated the border regions, killing many officials and people. The border ministers and soldiers cannot enter to persuade their inner intentions, thus increasing my lack of virtue.' Making agreements that are difficult to keep and seeking temporary benefits is not as good as cultivating culture and peaceful kinship for lifetime security.' Announce to the realm that those who again serve in the military shall be rewarded.' In summer, fourth month, he granted amnesty to the realm.

Each fulfills their duty, the realm is peaceful and the ruler honored, the people prosperous and the state secure.' Altogether fourteen generations, yet the realm is harmonious, without the disaster of weapons.' Now the emperor has collapsed, yet causing heavy mourning to last long, suffering the count of cold and heat, grieving fathers and sons, injuring the will of the elders, harming their food and drink, cutting off sacrifices to ghosts and spirits, thus increasing my lack of virtue—what to tell the realm!' I have obtained protection of the ancestral temple, with my insignificant body entrusted above the world's rulers and kings for more than twenty years.'

Now fortunately with Heaven's years I can again serve the Gao Temple. My unenlightened state and joy—how can there be grief and longing!' Order all officials and people that when the command arrives, go out to mourn for three days, then all remove mourning clothes.' No prohibition on taking wives, marrying daughters, sacrificing, drinking wine, or eating meat.' Those who should provide mourning affairs and attend in mourning clothes, all without stepping (on certain areas).' Nephew's belts no more than three inches.' Those attending mourning, each morning and evening make fifteen cries of lamentation, then the ritual is complete and ends.' Except for morning and evening at the time of attendance, prohibit unauthorized crying.' After burial, wear great red for fifteen days, small red for fourteen days, fine mourning for seven days, then remove mourning clothes.' Those not in the command, all follow this command proportionally.' Announce to the realm, no prohibition.' In the thirty-fourth year, winter, tenth month, yi-si day, the emperor collapsed in Weiyang Palace. The bequeathed edict said: 'I have heard that all things in the realm that sprout and grow inevitably die.' Death is the principle of Heaven and Earth, the natural course of things.' How can there be excessive grief!' In the present time, the world all values life and hates death, lavish burials to ruin livelihoods, heavy mourning to harm life,' I greatly disapprove.' Also announce to the realm, let them know my intention.'",
