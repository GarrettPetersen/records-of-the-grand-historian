          "literal": "By the reigns of Emperors Ai and Ping, all the kings were distant descendants of the original imperial family, born and raised in isolated palaces. They commanded no respect from officials or commoners, their power no different from that of wealthy commoners. Moreover, the dynasty had brief reigns with three successions broken. Therefore Wang Mang knew that the Han dynasty was exhausted and weak both internally and externally, root and branch feeble. Having nothing to fear, he conceived his treacherous ambitions. Relying on the empress dowager's power and claiming the mantle of the ancient sages Yi Yin and Duke Zhou, he monopolized authority in the imperial court, controlling the empire's fate without leaving the palace halls. His deceitful schemes accomplished, he seized the imperial throne facing south. He dispatched his Five Majesty officials and sent imperial couriers galloping throughout the empire to proclaim his divine mandates. The Han dynasty's feudal kings knelt with bowed heads, presenting the imperial seals and cords. They feared only falling behind others. Some even composed flattering praises of virtue to curry favor. How lamentable this is! Therefore, by thoroughly examining the cycles of rise and fall, strength and weakness, we gain clear lessons for the future.",
