In ancient times Zheng Wu Gong wished to attack Hu, thus married his son to them. Then asked the ministers: 'I wish to use troops, who can be attacked?' Guan Qi Si said: 'Hu can be attacked.' Thus executed Guan Qi Si, said: 'Hu is brother state, you speak of attacking it, why?' Hu lord heard it, considered Zheng close to himself and did not prepare against Zheng. Zheng people attacked Hu, took it. These two persuaders, their knowledge all appropriate, yet the severe one executed, the light one suspected. Not that knowledge is difficult, but applying knowledge is difficult.",
