          "text": "Xian Gong privately told Li Ji: 'I wish to abolish the crown prince and establish Xi Qi instead.' Li Ji wept and said: 'The crown prince's establishment has already been known by all feudal lords, and he has often led troops, with the hundred clans attaching to him. How can I, a lowly concubine, cause the lord to abolish the proper heir and establish the concubine-born? If the lord must do this, I will kill myself.' Li Ji pretended to praise the crown prince, but secretly sent people to slander and harm him, all while scheming to establish her own son. In the twenty-first year, Li Ji told the crown prince: 'The lord dreamed of seeing Jiang of Qi, so the crown prince should quickly sacrifice at Quwo and return blessing to the lord.' The crown prince then sacrificed to his mother Jiang of Qi at Quwo and offered his sacrificial meat to Xian Gong. Xian Gong was out hunting at the time and had placed the meat in the palace. Li Ji sent people to secretly put poison in the meat. After two days, Xian Gong returned from hunting and wished to eat the meat. Li Ji stopped him from the side, saying: 'The meat came from far away, so it should be tested.' They sacrificed to the ground and the ground swelled; gave it to the dog and the dog died; gave it to the servant and the servant died. Li Ji wept and said: 'How cruel the crown prince is! He wishes to kill his own father and replace him - moreover, what of others? The lord is old now, morning and evening a person, yet he cannot wait and wishes to kill him!' She told Xian Gong: 'The reason the crown prince acts this way is only because of me and Xi Qi. I beg to take my son and leave to another country. If we wait until we kill ourselves, it would be better than letting mother and son be fish and meat to the crown prince. I initially advised the lord not to abolish him, but hated it. Until now, I especially feel lost in this matter.' The crown prince heard this and fled to Xin City. Xian Gong was angry and executed the crown prince's tutor Du Yuan Kuan. Some told the crown prince: 'The one who made this poisoned meat is Li Ji. Why doesn't the crown prince personally explain and clarify it?' The crown prince said: 'My lord is old, without Li Ji he cannot sleep peacefully or eat sweetly. If I explain it, the lord will surely be angry with her.",

Therefore he sent troops to attack Pu. Pu's eunuch Bo Di commanded Chong Er to quickly kill himself. Chong Er climbed over the wall, but the eunuch pursued him and cut off a piece of his robe. Chong Er then fled to the Di tribe. They sent people to attack Qu, but Qu defended and could not be taken. This year, Jin again borrowed the road at Yu to attack Guo. Yu's minister Gong Zhi Qi advised Yu's lord: 'Jin cannot be allowed to borrow the road, for this will surely extinguish Yu.' Yu's lord said: 'Jin is of the same clan as us, they should not attack us.' Gong Zhi Qi said: 'Tai Bo and Yu Zhong were sons of King Tai, but Tai Bo fled away, so he was not the successor. Guo Zhong and Guo Shu were sons of King Ji, serving as ministers to King Wen, their merits recorded in the royal chamber and stored in the alliance repository. If Guo is extinguished, what will you cherish in Yu? Moreover, if Yu's relatives are as close as the Huan and Zhuang clans? The Huan and Zhuang clans - what crime did they commit?",

          "text": "Yi Wu was about to flee to Di. Ji Rui said: 'This is not possible. Chong Er is already in Di, now if we go, Jin will surely shift troops to attack Di, and Di will fear Jin, bringing calamity upon us. It would be better to flee to Liang, for Liang is near Qin, and Qin is strong. Our lord's son will be able to seek to return after a hundred years.' They then fled to Liang. In the twenty-fifth year, Jin attacked Di, but Di attacked Jin at Nie Sang because of Chong Er, and Jin's troops dispersed and left. At this time, Jin was strong, controlling the west bank of the Yellow River with Qin as border, the north bordering Di, and east reaching within the He River. Li Ji's younger brother gave birth to Dao Zi. In summer of the twenty-sixth year, Duke Huan of Qi assembled the feudal lords at Kui Qiu. Jin Xian Gong was ill and set out to go but did not arrive, meeting Zhou's steward Kong. Steward Kong said: 'Duke Huan of Qi is increasingly arrogant, attending to distant strategy rather than virtue, the feudal lords are not at peace. Your younger brother should not attend, for there will be no harm to Jin.' Xian Gong was also ill and returned. His illness became serious, so he told Xun Xi: 'I establish Xi Qi as successor, but he is young, the various ministers will not submit, fearing disorder will arise. Can you establish him?' Xun Xi said: 'I can.' Xian Gong said: 'What will serve as proof?' He replied: 'To make the dead live again and the living not feel ashamed - that will serve as proof.' Thus he entrusted Xi Qi to Xun Xi. Xun Xi became chancellor and managed the state government.",

          "text": "In spring of the sixth year, Qin's Mu Gong led troops to attack Jin. Jin's Hui Gong told Qing Zheng: 'Qin's troops have gone deep - what should we do?' Zheng said: 'Qin helped establish the lord, but the lord betrayed their bribe; when Jin suffered famine Qin transported grain, but when Qin suffers famine Jin betrays them, moreover wishing to take advantage of their famine to attack them. Their deep penetration is only fitting.' Jin divined the driver and assistant, and Qing Zheng were all auspicious. The duke said: 'Zheng is disrespectful.' Thus he changed to command Bu Yang to drive and Jia Pu Tu as assistant, advancing troops. In the ninth month, on Wu Xu, Qin's Mu Gong and Jin's Hui Gong battled at Han Yuan. Hui Gong's horse stumbled and could not advance, Qin's troops arrived, and he was in distress, so he summoned Qing Zheng to drive. Zheng said: 'Without divination, defeat would be fitting anyway.' Thus he left. He changed to command Liang You Mi to drive and Guo She as assistant, attacking Qin's Mu Gong. Mu Gong's brave warriors took the risk and defeated Jin's army, so Jin's army was defeated, but they lost Qin's Mu Gong and instead captured and returned with Jin's duke. Qin wished to sacrifice to Shangdi. Jin's lord's elder sister was Mu Gong's wife, who wailed in mourning clothes. The duke said: 'I obtained Jin's duke to make him entertainment, but now it is like this. Moreover I have heard Ji Zi say when Tang Shu was first enfeoffed: \"His descendants will surely be great.\" How can Jin be extinguished?' Thus he made an alliance with Jin's duke at Wang City and permitted him to return. Jin's duke also sent Lu Sheng and others to report to the country's people: 'I, though obtaining return, have no face to see the state altars, so divine a day to establish Zi Yu.' Jin's people heard it and all cried. Qin's Mu Gong asked Lu Sheng: 'Is Jin peaceful?' He answered: 'Not peaceful. The small people fear losing their lord and perishing relatives, do not dare to establish Zi Yu, saying \"we must repay enmity, would rather serve Rong or Di.\" Their gentlemen love their lord and know their crime, waiting for Qin's command, saying \"we must repay virtue.\" There are these two reasons, so not peaceful.' Thus Qin's Mu Gong changed to lodge Jin's Hui Gong and presented him seven cattle. In the eleventh month, he returned Jin's duke. Jin's duke arrived in the country, executed Qing Zheng, and cultivated government and teachings. He plotted: 'Chong Er is outside, many feudal lords profit by welcoming him.'",
