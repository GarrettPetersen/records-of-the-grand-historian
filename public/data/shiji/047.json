Prepared left and right marshals. Met the Qi duke at Jiagu, established altar positions, earthen steps three levels, met with meeting etiquette, bowed and yielded and ascended. The offering and toasting rituals completed, Qi officials hurried forward saying: 'Please perform the music of the four directions.' Duke Jing said: 'Very well.' Thus banners, yak tails, feathers, halberds, spears, swords, shields, drums, and shouting arrived. Confucius hurried forward, ascended the steps without completing one level, raised his sleeve and spoke: 'Our two lords make a friendly meeting, why is barbarian music here! Please command the officials!' The officials repelled them, they did not leave, then looked left and right at Yan Ying and Duke Jing. Duke Jing was ashamed in heart, waved them away. After a while, Qi officials hurried forward saying: 'Please perform inner palace music.' Duke Jing said: 'Very well.' Actors and dwarfs performed plays and advanced. Confucius hurried forward, ascended the steps without completing one level, said: 'Common fellows who deceive feudal lords, their crime deserves execution! Please command the officials!' The officials applied the law, hands and feet separated. Duke Jing was fearful and moved, knew righteousness was inferior, returned and greatly feared, told his ministers: 'Lu assists its lord with the way of gentlemen, but you alone teach me the way of barbarians, causing me to offend the Lu lord, what can be done?' The officials advanced replying: 'Gentlemen apologize for mistakes with sincerity, petty men apologize for mistakes with words. If your lordship regrets it, then apologize with sincerity.' Thus the Qi duke returned the invaded Lu territories of Yun, Wen Yang, and Gui Yin to apologize for the offense.",
