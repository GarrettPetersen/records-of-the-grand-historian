Chen Sheng and Wu Guang were both selected to go and made company commanders. Just then there was a great rainstorm, the roads became impassable, and they realized they would miss their deadline. Missing the deadline meant execution by law. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang then conspired, saying: 'Now, fleeing means death, but starting a great enterprise also means death. Since death is certain either way, why not die for our country?' Chen Sheng said: 'The world has suffered under Qin rule for a long time. I have heard that the Second Emperor is the younger son and should not have ascended. The one who should have been emperor is Prince Fusu.' Because Fusu frequently remonstrated, the First Emperor sent him to command troops on the frontier. Now it is rumored that he was innocent, but the Second Emperor killed him. The common people have heard much of his virtue, but do not know he is dead. Xiang Yan was a Chu general who achieved many victories, loved his soldiers, and the Chu people pitied him. Some think he is dead, others think he has fled. Now if we use our forces to falsely claim to be Prince Fusu and Xiang Yan, and start the uprising for all under heaven, many should respond to us.' Wu Guang agreed. So they consulted an oracle. The diviner knew their intentions and said: 'Your affairs will all succeed and you will achieve merit. However, you are consulting the spirits!' Chen Sheng and Wu Guang were delighted, thinking about the spirits, and said: 'This teaches us to first awe the masses.' So they wrote in cinnabar on silk 'Chen Sheng will be king' and placed it in the belly of a fish someone was netting. The soldiers bought the fish and cooked it, finding the writing in the belly, and were already amazed by it. They also forced Wu Guang to go to the shrine in the bushes by their camp, where at night he lit torches and imitated a fox's cry shouting 'Great Chu rises, Chen Sheng will be king.' The soldiers were all frightened that night. The next day, the soldiers whispered among themselves, all pointing at Chen Sheng.",

The guest came and went more freely, speaking of the Chen king's old feelings. Someone advised the Chen king: 'This guest is foolish and ignorant, monopolizes conversations, and treats your majesty lightly.' The Chen king executed him. All the Chen king's old friends then withdrew of their own accord; from this point on, no one was close to the Chen king.

When generals took territory and arrived, if their orders weren't followed, he bound and punished them, considering harsh scrutiny as loyalty. Those he disliked, he didn't hand over to officials but personally handled their punishment. The Chen king trusted them. Because of this, the generals were not close to him—this was why he failed.",
