Could you conduct a small test of drilling troops?' He replied: 'Acceptable.' Helü said: 'Could you test with women?' He said: 'Acceptable.' So he was permitted to do so. Palace ladies were selected, one hundred and eighty of them. Sun Tzu divided them into two teams, with the king's two favored consorts as team leaders for each, and commanded all of them to hold halberds. He commanded them saying: 'Do you know your heart and your left right hand back?' The women said: 'We know them.' Sun Tzu said: 'Forward, then look at the heart; left, look at the left hand; right, look at the right hand; back, then look at the back.' The women said: 'Yes.' Once the rules were laid out, he set up the axe and halberd, and repeated the commands three times and explained them five times. Then he drummed to the right, and the women burst out laughing. Sun Tzu said: 'The rules are unclear, the commands are not familiar—the general's fault.' He repeated the commands three times and explained them five times, then drummed to the left, and the women again burst out laughing. Sun Tzu said: 'The rules are unclear, the commands are not familiar—the general's fault; once they are clear but not followed, it is the officers and soldiers' fault.' He was about to execute the team leaders on left and right. King Wu watched from the terrace above, and seeing that his beloved consorts were about to be executed, he was greatly alarmed. He hurriedly sent a messenger down with orders: 'I already know the general can use troops. Without these two consorts, my food has no flavor. Please do not execute them.' Sun Tzu said: 'I have already received the command to be general; when in the army, the general does not accept the sovereign's orders.' He executed the two team leaders as an example. He appointed their seconds as team leaders, then drummed again. The women moved left right forward back, kneeling and standing—all conformed to the rules and regulations, none dared make a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to report to the king: 'The troops are now well-ordered. Your Majesty can come down to observe them. Whatever you wish to use them for, even if it means charging into water or fire, they will do it.' King Wu said: 'General, please retire to your quarters. I do not wish to come down and observe.' Sun Tzu said: 'The king only likes the words but cannot use the reality.' Thus Helü knew Sun Tzu could use troops and finally appointed him as general.
