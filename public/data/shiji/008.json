The heroic gentlemen and officials of Pei heard that the magistrate had an important guest and all went to offer congratulations. Xiao He was the supervising clerk in charge of reception; he issued orders to all the gentlemen saying: \"Those whose gifts are less than a thousand cash shall sit in the lower hall.\" Gao Zu as Pavilion Head had always treated the officials casually, so he falsely wrote on his visiting card 'Gift of ten thousand cash,' though he actually carried not a single coin. When the card was sent in, Lü Gong was greatly surprised, rose, and welcomed him at the gate. Lü Gong liked reading people's physiognomy; seeing Gao Zu's appearance, he consequently held him in high regard, invited him in, and seated him. Xiao He said: \"Liu Ji is always full of grand talk but accomplishes little.\" Gao Zu then treated the guests familiarly and sat in the seat of honor without any humility. When wine was exhausted, Lü Gong signaled with eyes to firmly keep Gao Zu. Gao Zu finished the wine and remained after. Lü Gong said: \"I have long liked reading physiognomy and have read many people, but none compare to Ji's; I hope Ji will take care of himself. I have a daughter and wish her to be Ji's humble wife.\" When the wine ended, Dame Lü was angry at Lü Gong, saying: \"You always wanted to treat this daughter as exceptional and give her to a noble person. The Pei magistrate is on good terms with you and sought her but you did not give her—why do you rashly promise her to Liu Ji?\" Lü Gong said: \"This is not something children and women can understand.\" He finally gave her to Liu Ji.

He then made Li Yiji Lord of Guangye and Li Shang a general to command the troops of Chenliu and together attack Kaifeng, but Kaifeng did not fall. Going west they fought with Qin general Yang Xiong at Baima, and again fought east of Quyu, greatly breaking them. Yang Xiong fled to Yingyang; the Second Emperor sent an envoy to behead him as a warning. They attacked Yingyang to the south and massacred it. Through Zhang Liang they then took the territory of Han at Huanyuan.",

When the King of Han went to his state, King Xiang sent thirty thousand troops to follow; those from Chu and the feudal lords who admired and followed numbered several tens of thousands; they entered Shizh from south of Du. As they departed they immediately burned and severed the plank roads to prepare against the feudal lords' troops raiding them, and also to show Xiang Yu they had no intention of going east. Reaching Nanzheng, many generals and officers and troops escaped on the road and returned; the officers and troops all sang songs longing to return east. Han Xin persuaded the King of Han, saying: \"Xiang Yu made kings of generals who had achievements, while the king alone resides at Nanzheng—this is exile. The military officers and troops are all men from east of the mountains; day and night they stand on tiptoe longing to return—use them while they are at their peak and you can achieve great merit.

Why is it that the Xiang clan lost all under Heaven?\" Gao Qi and Wang Ling replied: \"Your Majesty is informal and makes light of people; Xiang Yu was benevolent and loved people. Yet Your Majesty has men attack cities and take territory; those who are subdued and surrender are consequently given it—you share benefits with all under Heaven. Xiang Yu was jealous of the worthy and envious of the able; those with achievements he harmed, the worthy he suspected; when battles were won he would not give others credit, when territory was obtained he would not give others benefits—this is why he lost all under Heaven.\" Gao Zu said: \"You know one aspect but do not know the second. In devising strategies within the command tent and deciding victory a thousand li away, I am not equal to Zifang. In stabilizing the state, comforting the hundred clans, providing provisions and grain, and not severing the supply routes, I am not equal to Xiao He. In commanding armies of a million, certainly winning battles and certainly taking what is attacked, I am not equal to Han Xin. These three are all heroes among men, and I was able to employ them—this is why I took all under Heaven. Xiang Yu had one Fan Zeng but could not employ him—this is why he became my captive.\"",
