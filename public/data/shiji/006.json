Palaces, chariots, horses, clothing, parks, and hunting were all at Ai's disposal. Matters great and small were all decided by Ai. Moreover, Hexi and Taiyuan commanderies were made into the State of Ai. In the ninth year, a comet appeared, some say across the entire sky. They attacked Wei's Yuan and Puyang. In the fourth month, the king stayed at Yong. On the jiyou day, the king was capped and wore his sword. Marquis Changxin Ai created disorder and was discovered; he forged the king's seal and the Queen Mother's seal to mobilize county troops, palace guards, official cavalry, Rong and Di nobles, and retainers, intending to attack Qinian Palace and create chaos. The king learned of this and ordered Prime Minister Lord Changping and Lord Changwen to mobilize troops to attack Ai. They fought at Xianyang, beheaded several hundred; all were granted ranks of nobility, and eunuchs who participated in the battle were also granted one rank of nobility. Ai and his followers were defeated and fled. An immediate decree was issued throughout the state: whoever captures Ai alive will receive a million cash; whoever kills him, five hundred thousand. They captured all of Ai's followers. Guard Commander Jie, Palace Attendant Si, Assistant Yijie, Palace Gentleman Commander Qi, and twenty others all had their heads displayed. They were torn apart by chariots as a warning, and their clans were exterminated. As for his retainers, the lesser offenders were made to gather firewood for sacrifices. More than four thousand families who were stripped of rank and relocated to Shu were settled at Fangling. In that month there was severe cold and freezing; some died. Yang Duanhe attacked Yanshi. A comet appeared in the west and again in the north, extending south from the Dipper constellation for eighty days. In the tenth year, Prime Minister Lü Buwei was dismissed for his connection with Lao Ai. Huan He became general. Qi and Zhao came to hold banquets. Mao Jiao of Qi persuaded the King of Qin, saying: \"Qin is now concerned with all under Heaven, yet Your Majesty has the reputation of exiling his mother the Queen Mother; I fear the feudal lords will hear of this and thereby turn against Qin.\" The King of Qin then welcomed the Queen Mother from Yong and brought her into Xianyang, and she again resided at Ganquan Palace.",

Numbers used six as the base: tallies and official caps were all six inches, carriages were six feet, six feet made one pace, and they rode six horses. The Yellow River was renamed De River, marking the beginning of the Water virtue. Firm, resolute, stern, and profound, all matters were decided by law, severe and without benevolence, kindness, harmony, or righteousness, only then matching the number of the Five Virtues. Thereupon laws became harsh, and those imprisoned long were not pardoned.",

Making the feudal states into commanderies and counties, people all feel secure and happy, without the troubles of warfare, to be transmitted for ten thousand generations.

A true person enters water without getting wet, enters fire without burning, rides cloud qi, and lives as long as Heaven and Earth. Now the superior governs all under Heaven but has not yet achieved tranquility. I hope the superior's residences are not made known to people; only then can the medicine of immortality probably be obtained.\" Thereupon the First Emperor said: \"I admire the true person; I shall call myself 'true person,' not 'zhen.'\" He then ordered that within two hundred li around Xianyang, two hundred seventy palaces and observation towers be connected by elevated roadways and walled passages; curtains, bells, drums, and beautiful women filled them, each assigned by register and not moved. Wherever he traveled and stayed, anyone who spoke of his location was punished by death. The First Emperor visited Liangshan Palace; from the mountain he saw the prime minister's chariots and cavalry entourage and was displeased. Someone among the palace attendants informed the prime minister, and the prime minister later reduced his chariots and cavalry. The First Emperor was angry and said: \"Someone among the palace attendants leaked my words.\" He investigated and questioned them, but none confessed. At that time, he decreed the arrest of all those who were nearby at the time, and they were all killed. From then on, no one knew where he traveled. When he attended to affairs, the assembled ministers received decisions on matters all at Xianyang Palace.",

The First Emperor was displeased; he had scholars compose poems about immortals and true persons, and as he traveled throughout the land, had musicians sing and play them. In autumn, an envoy from east of the passes at night passed through Huayin on the Pingshu road; someone holding a jade disk blocked the envoy and said: \"Give this to the Lord of Haochi for me.\" He then said: \"This year the ancestral dragon will die.\" The envoy asked why, but the person suddenly disappeared, leaving the jade disk. The envoy presented the jade disk and reported everything he had heard. The First Emperor was silent for a long while, then said: \"Mountain spirits can only know one year's events.\" Withdrawing he said: \"The ancestral dragon refers to the ancestor of men.\" He had the imperial treasury examine the jade disk; it was the disk that had been cast into the river when crossing the Yangtze in the twenty-eighth year.

In the thirty-seventh year, he personally toured all under Heaven, comprehensively surveying distant regions. He then ascended Kuaiji, proclaimed and inspected customs; the black-headed people were reverent and solemn. The assembled ministers recited his achievements, traced the origins of events, and pursued his lofty brilliance. The Qin sage governed the state, first established criminal names, and clearly displayed ancient regulations. Initially he leveled laws and regulations, carefully distinguished official duties, to establish permanent standards. The six kings were monopolistic and treacherous, greedy, cruel, arrogant, and fierce, leading masses to strengthen themselves. Violent and tyrannical, they acted with abandon, relying on force they were arrogant, frequently mobilizing troops. Secretly they sent covert envoys, using affairs to form vertical alliances, acting in devious ways. Internally they adorned themselves with deceitful plots, externally they came to invade borders, thereby bringing about disaster. With righteous authority he executed them, completely extinguished violent rebels; chaotic traitors were destroyed. His sage virtue was broadly profound; within the six directions, his beneficence spread without limit. The Emperor unified the universe, comprehensively attended to all affairs; far and near all were thoroughly purified. Managing and governing the multitude of things, examining and verifying actual affairs, each bearing its name. Noble and base both communicated, good and bad were displayed before him; there was nothing hidden. He adorned, examined, and proclaimed righteousness: having a son yet marrying another, betraying the deceased, being unchaste. Separating inside and outside, prohibiting and stopping licentiousness; men and women were pure and sincere. If a husband was a stud boar, killing him incurred no punishment; males held to the righteous standard. If a wife eloped, the son could not obtain his mother; all were transformed to be honest and pure. Greatly governing and purifying customs, all under Heaven received the wind of transformation, bathed in his splendid teachings.

On the bingyin day of the seventh month, the First Emperor died at the Pingtai of Shaqiu. Prime Minister Si, because the emperor died away from the capital, feared that the princes and all under Heaven would revolt, so he kept it secret and did not announce the death. The coffin was placed in a warm-cool carriage; his formerly favored eunuchs attended; wherever they arrived food was presented to the emperor. The hundred officials submitted memorials as usual, and eunuchs from within the warm-cool carriage would approve the submitted memorials. Only Prince Huhai, Zhao Gao, and five or six favored eunuchs knew the emperor had died. Zhao Gao had formerly taught Huhai writing and prison law matters, and Huhai privately favored him.

The former emperor's great ministers are all people from families renowned and noble for generations throughout the land, with accumulated achievements and service transmitted from generation to generation for a long time. Now I, Gao, am of lowly origin; Your Majesty graciously promoted me, placing me in a high position, managing internal affairs. The great ministers are resentful and discontent, only outwardly following me as minister; in their hearts they truly do not submit. Now that the superior has gone out, if you do not use this time to investigate commandery and county governors and commandants with crimes and execute them, above you can demonstrate your awesome power to all under Heaven, below you can eliminate those from the superior's life whom you cannot tolerate. Now is not the time to model on civil culture but to decide by martial force; I hope Your Majesty will follow the times without hesitation, and the assembled ministers will not have time to plot. If a brilliant lord gathers and elevates the remaining people, ennobles the base, enriches the poor, draws near the distant, then above and below will unite and the state will be secure.\" The Second Emperor said: \"Good.\" He then executed great ministers and various princes; due to collective punishment for crimes, arrests reached junior palace officials of the three ranks of attendants, none could be installed, and six princes were executed at Du. Prince Jianglü and his two brothers were imprisoned in the inner palace and their crimes were to be deliberated later. The Second Emperor sent an envoy to order Jianglü: \"Prince, you have been disloyal; your crime merits death; officials will apply the law.\" Jianglü said: \"In court rituals, I have never dared not follow protocol as a guest; in halls and temples, I have never dared lose propriety; in receiving commands and responding to them, I have never dared speak improperly. How am I disloyal? I wish to hear my crime before dying.\" The envoy said: \"I cannot discuss the plot; I am only carrying out the document.\" Jianglü then looked up to Heaven and cried out three times, saying: \"Heaven! I am innocent!\" The three brothers all shed tears, drew their swords, and committed suicide. The royal clan was alarmed and fearful.

Sheng proclaimed himself King of Chu, resided at Chen, and sent various generals to seize territory. Young men in Shandong commanderies and counties, suffering under Qin officials, all killed their governors, commandants, magistrates, and assistants and rebelled to respond to Chen She; they mutually proclaimed themselves lords and kings, formed vertical alliances facing west, claiming to attack Qin; their numbers were countless. An emissary sent to the east returned and reported the rebels to the Second Emperor. The Second Emperor was angry and imprisoned the official. When later envoys arrived, the emperor asked and they replied: \"They are bandits; the commandery governors and commandants are pursuing and capturing them; now all have been caught; this is not worth worrying about.\" The emperor was pleased. Wu Chen proclaimed himself King of Zhao, Wei Jiu as King of Wei, Tian Dan as King of Qi. The Duke of Pei rose at Pei. Xiang Liang raised troops in Kuaiji Commandery.",

Now Your Majesty is in the prime of youth and has just ascended the throne; how can you decide matters together with dukes and ministers at court? If affairs have errors, this shows the assembled ministers your shortcomings. The Son of Heaven is called 'zhen'; naturally his voice is not heard.\" Thereupon the Second Emperor constantly remained within the forbidden palace, deciding all affairs with Gao. Thereafter dukes and ministers rarely obtained audience; bandits and thieves increased further, while troops from Guanzhong mobilized eastward to attack bandits without end. Right Prime Minister Quji, Left Prime Minister Si, and General Feng Jie came forward to remonstrate, saying: \"Bandits east of the passes have risen together; Qin mobilizes troops to execute and attack them; those killed and lost are very numerous, yet still they do not stop. Bandits are numerous all because garrison service, grain transport, and construction work are bitter, and taxes are heavy. We request temporarily halting work on Epang Palace and reducing border garrison transport to the four frontiers. \" The Second Emperor said: \"I have heard from Hanzi who said: 'Yao and Shun's rafters were not scraped, thatched roofs not trimmed, they ate from earthen bowls and drank from earthen vessels; even the sustenance of a gate guard was no worse than this. Yu dug through Dragon Gate, opened the Great Xia, broke through river pavilions and waters, releasing them to the sea, personally holding the rammer and spade, his shins without hair; the labor of slaves and servants was not more severe than this.' The reason it is noble to possess all under Heaven is to be able to indulge one's will to the utmost; the lord emphasizes and clarifies laws, so those below dare not act improperly, thereby controlling all within the seas. The lords of Yu and Xia, though noble as Sons of Heaven, personally dwelt in actual poverty and hardship to serve the hundred clans; what need did they have for laws and standards? I am honored with ten thousand chariots without their reality; I want to create the carriages of a thousand chariots and the attributes of ten thousand chariots to fulfill my title and name. Moreover, the former emperor rose from among the feudal lords and unified all under Heaven; all under Heaven having been settled, externally he drove out the four barbarians to secure the borders, built palaces to proclaim his satisfaction, and you observe the former emperor's achievements and enterprises having order. Now in the two years since I ascended the throne, bandits have risen together; you cannot prohibit them, and moreover you want to stop what the former emperor was doing; above this does not repay the former emperor, below you do not exhaust loyal effort for me; why do you hold positions?\" He handed Quji, Si, and Jie over to officials, who investigated and charged them with other crimes. Quji and Jie said: \"Generals and prime ministers should not be humiliated.\" They committed suicide. Si was finally imprisoned and subjected to the five punishments.",

The Duke of Pei, leading several tens of thousands, had already captured Wuguan and sent people privately to Gao; Gao feared the Second Emperor would be angry and punishment would reach him personally, so he feigned illness and did not come to court. The Second Emperor dreamed that a white tiger bit off his left trace horse and killed it; his heart was uneasy, and he strangely inquired about dream interpretation. The divination said: \"The Jing River is causing calamity.\" The Second Emperor then fasted at Wangyi Palace, wishing to sacrifice to the Jing River, and sank four white horses. He sent an envoy to reproach Gao about bandit matters. Gao was afraid, so he secretly plotted with his son-in-law Yan Le, the Xianyang magistrate, and his younger brother Zhao Cheng, saying: \"The emperor does not listen to remonstrances; now affairs are urgent and he wants to direct blame to my clan. I want to replace the emperor and install Prince Ying. Prince Ying is benevolent and frugal; the hundred clans all support his words.\" He had the Palace Attendant Commander serve as internal support, falsely claiming there were major bandits, had Le summon officials and mobilize troops, forcibly kidnapped Le's mother and placed her at Gao's residence. He sent Le to lead officials and troops, over a thousand men, to the Wangyi Palace gate, bound the Guard Commander and Chief Clerk, and said: \"Bandits have entered here; why did you not stop them?\" The Guard Commander said: \"The surrounding guardhouses and deployed troops are very vigilant; how could bandits dare enter the palace?\" Le then beheaded the Guard Commander, directly led officials in, and shot as they went; palace attendants and eunuchs were greatly frightened, some fled, some resisted; those who resisted were immediately killed; dozens died. The Palace Attendant Commander and Le entered together and shot at the emperor's curtained seat. The Second Emperor was angry and summoned those around him, but all were panicked and confused and did not fight. Nearby was one eunuch who attended and did not dare leave. The Second Emperor entered the inner chambers and said to him: \"Why did you not warn me earlier? Now it has come to this!\" The eunuch said: \"I did not dare speak, therefore I survived. Had I spoken early, I would already have been executed; how would I have reached today?\" Yan Le came forward to the Second Emperor and enumerated his crimes: \"You have been arrogant and willful, executing and killing without proper cause; all under Heaven has rebelled against you together; you should make your own decision.\" The Second Emperor said: \"Can I see the prime minister?\" Le said: \"No.\" The Second Emperor said: \"I wish to obtain one commandery to be king.\" He did not permit it. He said again: \"I wish to be a marquis of ten thousand households.\" He did not permit it. He said: \"I wish to be a commoner with my wife and children, like the other princes.\" Yan Le said: \"I received orders from the prime minister to execute you on behalf of all under Heaven; though you speak much, I dare not relay it.\" He signaled his troops to advance.

It would be appropriate to be king as before; this is expedient.\" He installed the Second Emperor's elder brother's son, Prince Ying, as King of Qin. He had the black-headed people bury the Second Emperor in Yichun Garden south of Du. He ordered Prince Ying to fast, when he should appear at the temple to receive the king's seal. After fasting for five days, Prince Ying plotted with his two sons, saying: \"Prime Minister Gao killed the Second Emperor at Wangyi Palace; fearing the assembled ministers would execute him, he pretended righteously to install me. I have heard that Zhao Gao made an agreement with Chu to destroy the Qin royal clan and rule Guanzhong. Now he has me fast and appear at the temple; this is wanting to kill me in the temple. I will feign illness and not go; the prime minister will surely come himself; when he comes I will kill him.\" Gao sent people to request Prince Ying several times; Prince Ying did not go; Gao indeed came himself and said: \"Ancestral temple affairs are of great importance; why does the king not go?\" Prince Ying then stabbed and killed Gao at the fasting palace and exterminated Gao's three clans, displaying them as a warning throughout Xianyang. Prince Ying served as King of Qin for forty-six days; the Chu general Duke of Pei defeated the Qin army, entered Wuguan, and reached Beshang, sending someone to arrange Prince Ying's surrender. Prince Ying then tied a cord around his neck, rode in a plain white chariot drawn by white horses, presented the Son of Heaven's seal and tallies, and surrendered by the side of Zhidao.

          "text": "The Qin king was self-satisfied and did not inquire, thereby making errors and not changing. The Second Emperor inherited this and consequently did not reform; violent and tyrannical, he compounded the disaster. Prince Ying stood isolated without relatives, endangered and weak without support. The three lords were confused and never awakened their entire lives; that they perished, was this not appropriate? At this time, the age was not without deeply thoughtful scholars who understood transformation, but the reason they dared not exhaust loyalty and brush aside faults was that Qin customs had many taboos and prohibitions; loyal words not yet finished from the mouth and the body was already executed and destroyed. Therefore all the scholars throughout the land inclined their ears to listen, stood hesitantly with feet together, and clamped their mouths shut without speaking. Therefore the three lords lost the Way, loyal ministers dared not remonstrate, wise scholars dared not plan; all under Heaven was already in chaos, yet treachery was not reported above; is this not sorrowful! The former kings knew that obstruction and concealment harmed the state, so they established dukes, ministers, great officials, and lesser officials to adorn laws and establish punishments, and all under Heaven was governed. When strong, they prohibited violence and punished chaos, and all under Heaven submitted. When it was weak, the Five Hegemons led campaigns and the feudal lords followed. When it was reduced in power, internally it guarded itself, externally others remained attached, and the altars of soil and grain were preserved. Thus when Qin was at its peak with numerous laws and severe punishments, all under Heaven trembled; when it declined, the hundred clans were resentful and discontented, and all within the seas rebelled. Thus Zhou with its five ranks of nobility obtained the Way and lasted over a thousand years without being cut off. Qin failed in both beginning and end, and therefore did not last long. Viewing it from this perspective, the patterns of safety and danger are vastly different. A rustic proverb says: 'Not forgetting past affairs, they are the teacher of future affairs.' Therefore when the superior person governs a state, he observes high antiquity, verifies in the present age, considers human affairs, examines the principles of prosperity and decline, carefully considers the propriety of authority and power; going and staying have order, transformation and change have proper times; thus over long durations the altars of soil and grain are secure.",

He took south the lands ofhundred Yue, making them Guilin and Xiang commanderies; the lords ofhundred Yuebowed their heads and bound their necks,entrusted their livesto subordinate officials. He then sent Meng Tian north to build the Great Wall and guard the frontier defenses, driving back the Xiongnu over seven hundred li; the Hu people dared not venture south to pasture their horses, and their warriors dared not draw their bows to avenge their grievances. Thereupon he abolished the former kings' Way and burned the words of the hundred schools to make the black-headed people foolish. He razed famous cities, killed heroes and worthy men, collected all under Heaven's weapons and gathered them at Xianyang, melted down sharp blades and cast bells, to make twelve metal men and weaken the black-headed people. Then he cut through Mount Hua as walls, relied on the river as a ford, occupied billion-zhang high walls, and overlooked unfathomable valleys to create a defense. Excellent generals and powerful crossbows guarded strategic points; trusted officials and elite troops arrayed sharp weapons and challenged whoever came; all under Heaven was settled. In the Qin king's mind, he considered that Guanzhong's defenses, its golden walls of a thousand li, were a ten-thousand-generation enterprise for his descendants to rule as emperors.",

Qin emerged from the Warring States and ruled all under Heaven; its way did not change, its government did not reform; thus the means by which it took and held were not different. Alone possessing it, therefore its destruction could be immediate. If the Qin king had considered the affairs of earlier generations, combined the precedents of Yin and Zhou to regulate its government, later even if there were a licentious and arrogant ruler, there would not have been the danger of collapse. Therefore the Three Kings in establishing all under Heaven had illustrious titles and names, and long-lasting achievements and enterprises.",
