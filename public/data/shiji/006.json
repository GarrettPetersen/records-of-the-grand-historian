The Taiyuan commandery west of the river was again changed to Ai's state. In the ninth year, a comet was seen, or it crossed the sky. They attacked Wei's Yuan and Puying. In the fourth month, the emperor lodged at Yong. On Jiyou day, the king was crowned and belted with a sword. Lord Changxin Ai made rebellion and it was discovered. He falsified the king's imperial seal and the queen mother's seal to send county troops, guard troops, official riders, Rongdi lords and nobles, and attendants. He intended to attack the Qinian palace and cause rebellion. The king knew it and ordered Chancellor Lord Changping and Lord Changwen to send troops to attack Ai. They fought at Xianyang and beheaded several hundred. All were bestowed nobility, and the eunuchs who were in the battle were also bestowed nobility one level. Ai and the others were defeated and fled. He immediately ordered throughout the state: whoever captures Ai alive will be granted one million cash; whoever kills him, five hundred thousand.

Li Si therefore persuaded the Qin king, requesting to first take Han to frighten the other states. Thereupon he had Si go down to Han. The Han king was worried about it. With Han Fei he plotted to weaken Qin. The Daliang man Wei Liao came and persuaded the Qin king saying: 'With Qin's strength, the feudal lords are like rulers of commanderies and counties. I only fear that the feudal lords will ally together and suddenly strike unexpectedly. This is why Zhi Bo, Fu Cha, and King Min perished.' I wish Your Majesty not to love wealth and objects, but to bribe their powerful ministers to disrupt their plans. It will cost no more than three hundred thousand gold, and then the feudal lords can be exhausted.' The Qin king followed his plan. He saw Wei Liao with proud ceremony, and his clothes, food, and drink were the same as Liao's. Liao said: 'The Qin king as a person has a bee-like nose, long eyes, a determined bird-like breast, jackal voice, little kindness but a tiger-wolf heart. When in poverty he easily puts himself below others, but when he obtains his will he also lightly eats people.' I am in common clothes, yet when he sees me he often lowers himself below me.' Truly, if the Qin king obtains his will in the world, the world will all become captives.' One cannot travel with him for long.' He then fled away. The Qin king became aware and firmly stopped him. He made him the Wei of Qin state and finally used his strategies. And Li Si handled affairs.",

Therefore we raised troops and executed them, capturing their king. I considered it good, perhaps to cease weapons and armor.' The Zhao king had his chancellor Li Mu come to ally and covenant, therefore we returned their hostage son. But then they doubled the covenant and rebelled against our Taiyuan. Therefore we raised troops and executed them, getting their king. Zhao Gong Zi Jia then self-established as Dai king. Therefore we raised troops and struck to extinguish them. The Wei king initially agreed to submit and enter Qin, but then plotted with Han and Zhao to raid Qin. Qin's troops and officials executed them, then broke them. The Jing king offered west of Qingyang, but then rebelled against the agreement and struck our Nanguo commandery. Therefore we sent troops and executed them, got their king, and then pacified their Jing land. The Yan king was muddled and chaotic. His crown prince Dan secretly ordered Jing Ke to be a bandit. Our troops and officials executed them and extinguished their state. The Qi king used Hou Sheng's plan, cut off Qin envoys, and wished for rebellion. Our troops and officials executed them, captured their king, and pacified Qi land. I, with my tiny body, raised troops to execute violent chaos. Relying on the ancestral temple's spirit, the six kings all submitted to their crimes. The world is greatly settled.' Now if the name and title are not changed, there is no way to match our success and transmit it to later generations. Discuss the emperor title.' Chancellor Wan, Imperial Secretary Jie, Court Judge Si and others all said: 'Formerly the Five Emperors had territories of a thousand li. Beyond that were the hou fu and yi fu, where feudal lords either came to court or not, and the Son of Heaven could not control them. Now Your Majesty has raised righteous troops, executed remnant bandits, pacified and settled the world. Within the seas it is all commanderies and counties, laws and commands come from one unification. This has never existed since high antiquity, and the Five Emperors did not reach this. We ministers respectfully discussed with the scholars and said: 'In ancient times there was the Heaven Emperor, the Earth Emperor, and the Great Emperor. The Great Emperor is most noble.' We ministers, risking death, present the honored title: the king as 'Great Emperor'.

The king said: 'Remove 'great', attach 'emperor', adopt the high ancient 'emperor' position title, and be titled 'emperor.' The rest as discussed.' The decree said: 'Acceptable.' King Zhuang Xiang was retroactively honored as Great Supreme Emperor. The decree said: 'I have heard that in high antiquity there were titles but no posthumous names.

Honor and base, noble and base, do not exceed their order and conduct. Langye does not tolerate, all strive for chastity and goodness. Fine and large exhaust their strength, none dare be lazy or neglect. Distant and near avoid concealment, specialized in striving for solemnity and dignity. Upright and straight, sincere and loyal, affairs have constancy. The emperor's virtue preserves and stabilizes the four extremes. Execute chaos and remove harm, raise benefit and bring fortune. Restrain affairs by time, various productions multiply. The qianshou are peaceful and tranquil, not using weapons or armor. The six relatives mutually protect, ultimately without bandits or robbers. Joyful and happy receiving teaching, completely know the laws and forms. Within the six directions, the emperor's soil. West ford the flowing sands, south exhaust the north doors.

Pushe Zhou Qingchen advanced and praised, saying: 'In other times Qin's lands did not exceed a thousand li. Relying on Your Majesty's divine spirit and clear holiness, he pacified and settled within the seas, drove out the barbarian Yi. What the sun and moon shone upon, none did not submit and obey. He made the feudal lords into commanderies and counties. People each were peaceful and happy by themselves, without the troubles of warfare, transmitted to ten thousand generations. From high antiquity it did not reach Your Majesty's might and virtue.' The Beginning Emperor was pleased. Scholar Qi person Chun Yuyue advanced and said: 'I, your minister, have heard that the kings of Yin and Zhou lasted over a thousand years. They enfeoffed sons, younger brothers, and meritorious ministers, themselves making branch supports. Now Your Majesty possesses within the seas, yet sons and younger brothers are common men. Suddenly there are ministers like Tian Chang and the Six Ministers, without support or brush, how can they mutually save each other?' Affairs that do not take ancient as teacher yet are able to last long, are not what I have heard. Now Qingchen also flatters to the face to increase Your Majesty's errors. He is not a loyal minister.' The Beginning Emperor sent down their discussion. Chancellor Li Si said: 'The Five Emperors did not mutually repeat, the Three Dynasties did not mutually follow. Each governed with what was appropriate, not opposing and reversing each other. Time changed and was different. Now Your Majesty has created a great enterprise, established merit for ten thousand generations. This is certainly not what foolish scholars know. Moreover, Yue's words are matters of the Three Dynasties. What are they sufficient to model? In different times the feudal lords together contended, thickly recruiting wandering scholars. Now the world is already determined, laws and commands come out as one. When common people are at home they exert themselves in agriculture and labor, scholars study and learn the laws and commands to avoid prohibitions. Now the various scholars do not take the present as teacher but study the ancient, to oppose the current age, confusing and disordering the qianshou. Chancellor Minister Si, risking death, speaks: In ancient times the world was scattered and chaotic, none could unify it. Therefore the feudal lords together arose. Their words all spoke of ancient to harm the present, adorned empty words to disorder reality. People favored their private studies to oppose what superiors established. Now the emperor has united the world, distinguishes black and white and determines one honored. Private studies mutually go with illegal teachings. When people hear commands descend, they each discuss them with their studies. Entering, their hearts oppose; exiting, they discuss in alleys. They boast of their master as a name, take different things as high, lead the group below to make slander. Like this if not prohibited, then the ruler's power descends to the superiors, factions and alliances form below. Prohibiting it is convenient. I, your minister, request that court historians burn all records that are not of Qin. Those not in the charge of scholar officials: throughout the world, whoever dares hide poems, books, or the words of the hundred schools, shall completely go to the commandery governors and commandery lieutenants to mix and burn them. Whoever dares to discuss poems and books in pairs shall be abandoned in the market. Those who use ancient to oppose the present shall be clanned. Officials who see and know but do not report shall share the same crime. If the command descends thirty days and they do not burn, tattoo them as city morning.

Similar things have ones that are harmful to them. In the square, the person lord at times makes secret journeys to avoid evil ghosts. Evil ghosts avoid, true people arrive. If the person lord dwells somewhere and person ministers know it, then it harms the spirits. True people enter water without getting wet, enter fire without getting scorched, tread on cloud qi, lasting long with heaven and earth. Now His Majesty governs the world, not yet tranquil and calm. I wish that His Majesty's dwelling palaces not be known to people, then the medicine of immortality might almost be obtainable.' Thereupon the Beginning Emperor said: 'I admire true people. I call myself 'True Person', I do not use 'I'.' Then he ordered within two hundred li of Xianyang's side two hundred seventy palace buildings with covered ways and walled ways connected, filled with curtains, canopies, bells, drums, and beauties, each according to name not to move or transfer. Wherever he travels and favors, whoever speaks of its place, crime of death. The Beginning Emperor favored the Liangshan Palace. From the mountain top he saw the chancellor's chariots and cavalry were many. He did not think it good. Inner people or told the chancellor. The chancellor afterwards reduced his chariots and cavalry. The Beginning Emperor angered, saying: 'These inner people leaked my words.' He investigated and questioned, but none confessed. At that time, by edict he captured all those who had been at his side then, and killed them all. From this time after, none knew the location of his travels. He listened to affairs, ministers received decided affairs, all at Xianyang Palace.",

He then secretly plotted with Zhao Gao, saying: 'The ministers do not submit, the officials are still strong, and the various princes will certainly contend with me. What to do about it?' Gao said: 'I, your minister, certainly wished to speak but did not dare. The former emperor's ministers were all the world's accumulated generations of famous noble people, who had accumulated merits and labors for generations mutually transmitted for a long time already. Now I, Gao, was originally small and lowly. Your Majesty fortunately praised and raised me, commanding me in an upper position to manage middle affairs. The ministers are dissatisfied. They specially with appearance follow as ministers, but their hearts actually do not submit. Now His Majesty goes out. Not taking this time to investigate the commanderies and counties' defenders and commandants who have crimes and execute them. Above to shake might throughout the world, below to remove those His Majesty in his lifetime disliked. Now the time does not model culture but decides at military force. I wish Your Majesty would then follow the time without doubt, then the ministers would not be able to plot. A bright lord collects and raises the remaining people, makes the lowly noble, the poor rich, the distant near, then upper and lower gather and the state is peaceful.' The Second Generation said: 'Good.' He then carried out executing the ministers and various princes. With crimes and faults, he connected and arrested a few close officials and three nobles. None were able to stand. Six princes were punished and died at Du. Prince Jianglü and his two brothers were imprisoned in the inner palace. Their crimes were discussed alone later. The Second Generation had an envoy command Jianglü, saying: 'Prince not minister, crime should die. Officials apply the law there.' Jianglü said: 'In the palace court's ceremonies, I never dared not follow as guest and assist; In the hall and temple's positions, I never dared lose integrity; In receiving commands and responding, I never dared lose words. What is called not minister? I wish to hear the crime and die.' The envoy said: 'I, your minister, am not able to plot with you. I received the letter and follow affairs.' Jianglü then faced heaven and greatly called to heaven three times, saying: 'Heaven ah! I have no crime!' The three brothers all flowed tears, drew swords, and committed suicide.

          "literal": "Zhao Gao persuaded the Second Generation, saying: 'The former emperor controlled and ruled the world for a long time. Therefore the ministers did not dare do wrong, advance evil sayings. Now Your Majesty is rich in spring and autumns, have initially ascended the position. Why with nobles in court decide affairs? Affairs then have errors, show the ministers your shortcomings. The emperor calls 'I', certainly does not hear the voice.' Thereupon the Second Generation constantly resided in the forbidden quarters, deciding all affairs with Gao. After that, the nobles rarely obtained morning audiences. Robbers and bandits increasingly many. The Guanzhong soldiers dispatched east to strike robbers had no end. Right Chancellor Qu Ji, Left Chancellor Si, General Feng Jie advanced and remonstrated, saying: 'East of the pass bandits together rose. Qin dispatched troops to execute and strike. Those killed and perished were very many, however still not stopped. Robbers are many. All because garrison, transport, labor matters are bitter. Taxes are heavy. Please temporarily stop the Efang Palace workers, reduce and save the four borders' garrisons and transports.' The Second Generation said: 'I heard Master Han say: 'Yao and Shun's thatched rafters were not scraped, thatched roofs not trimmed, ate from earthenware bowls, drank from earthenware cups. Though gatekeeper's nourishment, not different from this. Yu dug Longmen, connected Daxia, decided Hetting waters, released to sea. His body self-held hoe and spade, shins had no hair. Minister and captive labor was not more intense than this.' All those who are noble in having the world obtain unrestrained intentions and extreme desires. The lord makes heavy and clear laws. Below they do not dare do wrong, to control and rule within the seas. The lords of Yu and Xia were noble as emperors, personally dwelt in the reality of poor bitterness, to comply with the common people. What more at laws? I am honored with ten thousand chariots, but not its substance. I wish to make thousand chariots' equipage, ten thousand chariots' retinue, to fill my title and name. Moreover the former emperor rose from feudal lords, united the world. The world was already settled. Externally expelled the four barbarians to pacify the border limits. Made palace chambers to manifest self-satisfaction. And you observe the former emperor's achievements had continuity. Now I have ascended the position within two years' interval. Bandits together rose. You cannot prohibit. Moreover wish to dismiss what the former emperor did. This is above not able to repay the former emperor, next not exhausting loyal strength for me. Why be in position?' Sent down Qu Ji, Si, Jie as officials. Investigated and blamed other crimes. Qu Ji and Jie said: 'Generals and chancellors are not humiliated.' They committed suicide. Si was finally imprisoned and received the five punishments.",

Zhang Han and others' army several retreats. They memorialed requesting additional aid. Yan, Zhao, Qi, Chu, Han, Wei all established as kings. From east of the pass, for the most part all rebelled against Qin officials and responded to the feudal lords. The feudal lords all led their multitudes facing west. Pei Gong as general with several ten thousand people had already slaughtered Wuguan. He had a person privately approach Gao. Gao feared the Second Generation would anger and execute, reaching his person. He then declined illness and did not have morning audiences. The Second Generation dreamed a white tiger bit his left trace horse and killed it. His heart was not happy. He strangely asked for dream interpretation. The diviner said: 'The Jing water makes an evil spirit.' The Second Generation then purified at Wangyi Palace, wished to sacrifice to the Jing, and sank four white horses. He had an envoy reproach Gao with robber and bandit matters. Gao feared, then secretly plotted with his son-in-law Xianyang magistrate Yan Le and his younger brother Zhao Cheng, saying: 'His Majesty does not listen to remonstrations. Now affairs are urgent. He wishes to return calamity to my clan. I wish to change and place His Majesty, moreover establish Prince Ying. Zi Ying is benevolent and frugal. The common people all carry his words.' He had the Palace Attendant Commander as inner response, deceived by making as if there were great robbers. He commanded Le to summon officials and dispatch soldiers, pursue and rob Le's mother and place her in Gao's residence. He dispatched Le as general with officials and soldiers over a thousand people to Wangyi Palace hall gate. They bound the guard commander and deputy, saying: 'Robbers entered here. Why did you not stop them?' The guard commander said: 'The surrounding huts have soldiers set very carefully. How did robbers dare enter the palace?' Le then beheaded the guard commander, straight led officials entered, advanced shooting. The gentlemen and eunuchs were greatly startled. Some fled, some resisted. Those who resisted then died. Those who died were several tens of people. The Palace Attendant Commander with Le together entered and shot at His Majesty's canopy and seat curtains. The Second Generation angered, summoned the attendants. The attendants were all panicked and disturbed, did not fight. Beside there was one eunuch who served and did not dare leave. The Second Generation entered the inner quarters and said to him: 'Why did you not early tell me? It has reached to this!' The eunuch said: 'I, your minister, did not dare speak, therefore obtained wholeness. If they had made me, your minister, speak early, all would already be executed. How would I have obtained until now?' Yan Le advanced and approached the Second Generation, reproached him saying: 'You are arrogant and unrestrained, execute and kill without way. The world together rebels against you. You should make a plan for yourself.' The Second Generation said: 'Can the chancellor be seen?' Le said: 'Not possible.' The Second Generation said: 'I wish to obtain one commandery as king.' Not permitted. He again said: 'Wish to be a ten thousand households marquis.' Not permitted. He said: 'Wish with wife and children to be qianshou, compare to the various princes.' Yan Le said: 'I, your minister, received command from the chancellor, to execute you for the world. Though you have many words, I do not dare report.' He waved his troops to advance. The Second Generation committed suicide.",

Suppose the Second Generation had had ordinary lord conduct and employed the loyal and worthy. Minister and lord would be one heart worrying about within the seas' troubles. They would wear white silk and correct the former emperor's faults. Split land and divided people to enfeoff meritorious ministers' descendants. Built countries and established lords with rites for the world. Emptied prisons and freed punishments and executions. Removed confiscated properties and filthy crimes. Made each return to their villages. Opened granaries and scattered wealth and money to raise the isolated, alone, poor, and difficult scholars. Light taxes and few affairs to assist the common people's urgency. Simplified laws and reduced punishments to hold their later ones. Made all the world's people obtain self-renewal. Changed conduct and practiced. Each careful of their bodies. Filled the myriad people's hopes. And gave the world with might and virtue. The world would have gathered. Then within the four seas, all would be happy and each peacefully happy in their places, only fearing there was change. Though there were crafty and slippery people, none would have hearts separated from above. Then the not proper ministers would have no way to adorn their wisdom, and violent chaos evil would have stopped. The Second Generation did not practice this art, and was heavy with without way. He ruined clan temples with the people. Moreover began making the Efang Palace. Numerous punishments and strict executions. Officials' governance harsh and deep. Rewards and punishments not proper. Taxes and collections without measure. The world had many affairs. Officials were not able to record. Common people were poor and difficult, and the lord did not receive and care for them. Then evil and false together rose. Upper and lower mutually fled. Those falsely accused of crimes were many. Punishments and executions mutually seen on the road. And the world suffered it. From lords and nobles below to the common people, people cherished a self-danger heart. They personally dwelt in the reality of poor bitterness. All were not peaceful in their positions. Therefore they were easy to move. Therefore Chen She did not use Tang and Wu's worthiness, did not rely on dukes and marquises' honor. He raised arms at the great marsh and the world echoed and responded. Their people were dangerous. Therefore former kings saw the beginning and end changes, knew the existence and perishing mechanisms. Therefore the way of shepherding people was devoted to peace for them only. Though the world had contrary conduct ministers, there would certainly be no echoed and responded help. Therefore it is said 'peace people can practice righteousness with, and danger people are easy to do wrong with'. This is what is called. Noble as emperor, rich and had the world. The body did not escape punishments and killings. The governance was toppled and wrong. This was the Second Generation's fault.",
