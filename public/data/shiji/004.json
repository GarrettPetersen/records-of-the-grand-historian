Bu Xu lost his office and fled among the Rong and Di. Bu Xu died, and his son Ju was established. Ju died, and his son Gong Liu was established. Although Gong Liu was among the Rong and Di, he again took up Hou Ji's undertakings, devoting himself to farming and planting. He acted according to what the land was suitable for, crossed the Wei from Qi and Ju, took materials for use. Travelers had provisions, residents had stores of goods, and the people relied on his blessings. The common people cherished him, and many moved to settle and find protection there. The flourishing of the Zhou way began from this time. Therefore poets sang joyfully and thought of their virtue. Gong Liu died, and his son Qing Jie was established. Their state was at Bin.",

King Wu called himself Crown Prince Fa, saying he was upholding King Wen to attack, and dared not act on his own authority. Then he told the Minister of War, Minister of Works, Minister of Rites, and various officials: 'Be serious and attentive, truly! I have no wisdom. Because my ancestors had virtuous ministers, this young one has received the prior merit. I will completely establish rewards and punishments to determine their merit.' Then he raised the army. The Army Senior Father commanded: 'Assemble your multitudes. I give you boats and oars. Those who arrive late will be beheaded.' King Wu crossed the river. In mid-current, a white fish leaped into the king's boat. King Wu bent down, took it, and made sacrifice with it. Having crossed, there was fire that went from above and repeated below, arriving at Wangwu. It flowed and became a crow, its color red, its sound powerful like thunderclouds. At this time, the feudal lords met at Mengjin without prior arrangement—eight hundred feudal lords. All the feudal lords said: 'Zhou can be attacked now.'

King Wu held a yellow axe in his left hand and grasped a white banner in his right, using it to signal. He said: 'How far you people of the western lands have come!' King Wu said: 'Alas! I have the great lords of the state, the Minister of Works, Minister of War, Minister of Rites, the Ya Lu and Shi Shi, commanders of thousands and hundreds, and the people of Yong, Shu, Qiang, Mao, Wei, Lu, Peng, and Pu. Raise your spears, compare your shields, stand your lances. I will swear an oath.' The king said: 'The ancient people had a saying: 'A hen does not crow at dawn. If a hen crows at dawn, the household will be desolate.' Now King Zhou of Yin only uses the words of women, abandons his ancestors' free sacrifices without response. He darkly abandons his household and state, abandons his royal parents and brothers without using them. He honors and grows the many criminals and fugitives from the four directions, trusts and sends them. He causes tyranny toward the common people, with evil ways in the Shang state. Now I, Fa, will together execute Heaven's punishment. Today's matter is no more than six or seven steps. Then stop and align yourselves there. Gentlemen, exert yourselves! No more than four, five, six, or seven strikes. Then stop and align yourselves there. Exert yourselves, gentlemen! Be strong and unyielding, like tigers and bears, like leopards and wolves. At the Shang suburbs, do not resist those who overcome and flee. Serve the western lands. Exert yourselves, gentlemen! If you do not exert yourselves, slaughter will come upon your bodies.'

          "literal": "King Mu was about to campaign against the Quanrong. Ji Gong Moufu advised: 'It is not possible. The former kings shone with virtue and did not inspect troops. Indeed, troops are stored and only move at the right time. When they move, they inspire awe. When inspected, they become frivolous. When frivolous, they inspire no fear. This is why the ode of Zhou Wen Gong says: 'Loaded and stored the weapons, loaded and sheathed the bows and arrows. I seek excellent virtue, extending it to timely Xia. Truly the king protects it.' The former kings toward the people: luxuriantly corrected their virtue and thickened their nature, enriched their wealth-seeking and benefited their utensil use, clarified the directions of benefit and harm, and repaired them with culture. They made them devote themselves to benefit and avoid harm, cherish virtue and fear awe. Therefore they could preserve generations and increase greatly. Formerly my former kings, generation after generation, served Yu and Xia as Hou Ji. When Xia declined, they abandoned Ji and were not diligent. My former king Bu Xu lost his office because of this, and then fled himself among the Rong and Di. They dared not be lax in their undertakings, timely arranged their virtue, followed and repaired their continuation, repaired their instruction canons, and were respectfully diligent morning and evening. They guarded with sincere solidity and served with loyal trust. Many generations carried virtue and did not disgrace their predecessors. When it arrived at Wen Wang and Wu Wang, they illuminated the former brightness and added kind harmony. They served the spirits and protected the people. Nothing was not joyful. Shang king Di Xin was greatly evil toward the people. The common people could not bear it, united and carried Wu Wang, to bring weapons to the Shang pasture. This is why the former kings were not devoted to martial matters. They urged relief of the people's hidden sufferings and removed their harms. Indeed, the former kings' system: within the state dian service, outside the state hou service, hou wei bin service, yi man yao service, rong di huang service. Dian service: sacrifice. Hou service: ancestral rites. Bin service: present. Yao service: tribute. Huang service: king. Day: sacrifice. Month: rites. Season: present. Year: tribute. Finally: king. The former kings' orderly sacrifices: if there was no sacrifice, then they repaired their intention. If no rites, repaired their words. If no present, repaired their culture. If no tribute, repaired their name. If no king, repaired their virtue. When the order was complete and there were those who did not arrive, then they repaired with punishment. Thus there were punishments for not sacrificing, attacks for not performing rites, campaigns for not presenting, remonstrations for not tributing, and announcements for not kinging. Thus there were laws of punishment, troops for attacking and campaigning, preparations for campaigning and attacking, commands of awe and remonstration, and words of cultural announcements. When commands were spread and words arranged but there were those who did not arrive, then they increased repair at virtue, without laboring the people from afar. This is why nothing near did not listen, nothing far did not submit. Now, since the end of Da Bi and Bo Shi, the Quanrong clan came with their duty to king. The Son of Heaven said: 'I must campaign against them for not presenting, and moreover observe their troops.' Is this not abandoning the former kings' instruction, and will the king nearly collapse? I have heard that the Quanrong establish solidity, follow old virtue and guard the end purely and firmly. They have means to defend against me.' The king then campaigned against them and got four white wolves and four white deer to return with. From this time, the huang service did not arrive.",

Indeed, profit is what the hundred things are born from, what heaven and earth carry. If someone monopolizes it, the harm is great. Heaven and earth's hundred things will all take from it. How can it be monopolized? What has angered many people. Not prepared for great difficulties. With this teaching the king, will the king perhaps last long? Indeed, ruling people means guiding profit and distributing it to superiors and inferiors. Making spirits, people, and the hundred things all achieve their utmost, yet still daily alarmed and fearing resentment's coming. Therefore the Ode says: 'Think of cultured Hou Ji, who was able to match that heaven, established our numerous people, nothing was not your utmost.' The Great Elegant says: 'Display and bestow, carrying Zhou.' This did not distribute profit and feared difficulties, therefore could carry Zhou until now. Now the king learns to monopolize profit. Is this possible? A common man monopolizing profit is still called a thief. If the king does it, his following will be few. If Rong Gong is employed, Zhou will certainly fail.'

          "literal": "In the third year, King You favored and loved Bao Si. Bao Si gave birth to a son named Bo Fu. King You wished to depose the crown prince. The crown prince's mother was a woman of Shen Hou, and she was the queen. Later King You got Bao Si and loved her. He wished to depose the Shen queen and remove the crown prince Yi Jiu, making Bao Si the queen and Bo Fu the crown prince. Zhou's grand historian Bo Yang read the history records and said: 'Zhou has perished.' Formerly, when the Xia Hou clan declined, two spirit dragons stopped in the Xia emperor's court and spoke, saying: 'We are Bao's two lords.' The Xia emperor divined whether to kill them, drive them away, or let them stay. None were auspicious. He divined to request their saliva and store it, and then it was auspicious. Thus he spread silks and bamboo to announce it. The dragons were gone but the saliva remained. He boxed it and removed it. Xia perished, and this vessel was passed to Yin. Yin perished, and this vessel was again passed to Zhou. Compared to the three dynasties, none dared open it. Until the end of King Li's reign, it was opened and viewed. The saliva flowed in the court and could not be removed. King Li made women go naked and shout at it. The saliva transformed into a black turtle and entered the king's harem. A young concubine in the harem, already with teeth, encountered it. Already with hairpin, she became pregnant. Without a husband, she gave birth to a son. She feared it and abandoned him. In King Xuan's time, a young girl made a rhyme saying: 'Bows are bent, Ji is served—it actually perishes the Zhou state.' Thus King Xuan heard of it. There was a couple selling this vessel. King Xuan had them seized and executed. They fled on the road and saw a villager's harem young concubine abandoned monster child emerged on the road. They heard its night crying, pitied it and took it. The couple then fled and ran to Bao. A Bao person had committed a crime. He requested to present the young concubine abandoned girl to the king to redeem his crime. The abandoned girl emerged from Bao. She was Bao Si. During King You's third year, the king's harem saw her and loved her. She gave birth to a son named Bo Fu. He finally deposed the Shen queen and crown prince, making Bao Si the queen and Bo Fu the crown prince. Grand Historian Bo Yang said: 'The disaster is complete. Nothing can be done!'",
