So he secretly manufactured weapons while always wearing his father's general's seal and going out with the emperor's banners. Before King Yi was even buried, Jian took a fancy to King Yi's favored beauty Nao Ji and sent men at night to bring her to his chambers for illicit relations. When the Huainan affair broke out, the investigation of accomplices implicated both Jian and King Jian of Jiangdu. Jian became frightened and sent men with large amounts of gold and money to bribe officials and suppress the case. He also trusted sorcerers and witches, sending them to pray and make false claims. Jian also committed incest with all his sisters and brothers. When this became known, Han nobles requested Jian's arrest and trial. The Son of Heaven spared him and sent ministers to interrogate the king. The king admitted his crimes and committed suicide.
