          "text": "King Pengzu of Zhao was made King of Guangchuan as imperial son in Emperor Xiaojing's second year before his reign. After King Sui of Zhao's rebellion was crushed, Pengzu became King of Guangchuan. After four years, he was moved to become King of Zhao. After fifteen years, Emperor Xiaojing passed away. Pengzu was crafty and flattering by nature, outwardly respectful but inwardly deeply treacherous. He loved legal affairs and used clever arguments to trap people. Pengzu had many favored consorts in his palace and many children and grandchildren. If prime ministers and officials of two thousand shi wished to follow Han law to govern, it would harm the king's family. Therefore whenever prime ministers and officials of two thousand shi arrived, Pengzu would wear mourning clothes and personally go to welcome them. He would clear out the officials' residences and set up many suspicious matters to provoke them. If he caught them making slips of the tongue or taboo violations, he would record them. When officials of two thousand shi wished to govern, he would use this to coerce and threaten them. If they did not listen, he would submit memorials accusing them and slander them with charges of corruption and personal gain. Pengzu reigned for more than fifty years. No prime minister or official of two thousand shi could complete two years in office before being dismissed for crimes—major ones died, minor ones were punished. Therefore no officials of two thousand shi dared to govern. The King of Zhao monopolized power, sending envoys to counties to act as merchants and collect monopolies, bringing in more than the kingdom's regular taxes. Because of this the Zhao royal family had abundant gold and money, though what he bestowed on his consorts and sons also exhausted it all. Pengzu took the favored consort of King Yi of Jiangdu that King Jian had stolen and committed adultery with—Nao Ji—as his own consort, and loved her deeply.",
