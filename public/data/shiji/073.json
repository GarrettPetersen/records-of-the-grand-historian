I ask only that Your Majesty choose another worthy general.' Shihuang apologized: 'Enough. General, speak no more!' Wang Jian said: 'If Your Majesty must use me, 600,000 men are indispensable.' Shihuang said: 'I will follow your plan.' Wang Jian led 600,000 troops. Shihuang personally saw him off to Bashang. As Wang Jian departed, he requested many fine fields, houses, and gardens. Shihuang said: 'General is departing. Why worry about poverty?' Wang Jian said: 'As Your Majesty's general, even with merit I will never be enfeoffed as marquess. So while Your Majesty favors me, I also take this opportunity to request gardens and pools as property for my descendants.' Shihuang laughed heartily. Wang Jian reached the pass and sent messengers back five times requesting good fields. Some said: 'The general's begging is already excessive.' Wang Jian said: 'Not so.
