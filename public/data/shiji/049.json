Lady Wang knew the emperor despised Lady Li, and since his anger had not subsided, she secretly sent people to urge the ministers to establish Lady Li as empress. The Chamberlain for Ceremonials, having finished reporting on affairs, said: 'The saying goes \"The son is honored because of the mother, the mother is honored because of the son.\" Now the crown prince's mother has no title, she should be established as empress.' Emperor Jing was angry and said: \"Is this something you should say!\" He immediately investigated and executed the Chamberlain for Ceremonials, and deposed the crown prince to become King of Linjiang. Lady Li became even more resentful and furious, was not allowed to see him, and died of sorrow. Finally Lady Wang was established as empress, her son as crown prince, and the empress's brother Xin was enfeoffed as Marquis of Gai.",

When Emperor Wu first ascended the throne, for several years he had no sons. Princess Pingyang sought out more than ten daughters from good families, adorned them, and placed them in her household. Emperor Wu performed the purification ritual at Bashang and returned, passing by Princess Pingyang's residence. The princess presented the beauties in her service. The emperor was not pleased. After drinking, the singers came forward, and the emperor caught sight of them, but was particularly pleased with Wei Zifu alone. That day, Emperor Wu rose to change his clothes, and Zifu attended him in the carriage for court robes, where she received his favor. The emperor returned to his seat, extremely delighted. He granted Princess Pingyang a thousand jin of gold. The princess then memorialized to send Zifu into the palace. When Zifu boarded the carriage, Princess Pingyang patted her back and said: \"Go now, eat well, exert yourself! When you become noble, do not forget me.\" She entered the palace for more than a year, but was never favored again. Emperor Wu selected palace women who were not useful and expelled them to return home. Wei Zifu was able to be seen, wept and requested to leave. The emperor pitied her, favored her again, and she became pregnant, her honored favor increasing daily. He summoned her brother Wei Changjun and younger brother Qing to serve as attendants in the palace. Later Zifu was greatly favored and had honor, altogether bearing three daughters and one son. The son was named Ju.",

He said: Empress Wang, when she was among the common people, bore one daughter, whose father was Jin Wangsun. Wangsun had already died, after Emperor Jing's passing, Emperor Wu had already ascended, Empress Wang was alone. Han Wangsun named Yan had long been favored by Emperor Wu, and taking advantage of a moment, informed him that the empress had a daughter in Changling. Emperor Wu said: \"Why didn't you speak earlier!\" He sent envoys to first inspect her, and she was in their home. Emperor Wu then personally went to welcome and take her. Clearing the way, first sending out the feathered cavalry from the Hengcheng Gate, the imperial carriage galloped to Changling. At the small market, west into the alley, the alley gate was closed, they forcibly opened the gate, the imperial carriage went straight into this alley, proceeding until stopping outside the Jin family's gate, ordering armed cavalry to surround their residence, fearing she would flee, personally going to fetch her so she could not escape. He then ordered the ministers on his left and right to enter and call for her. The family was alarmed and terrified, the girl fled and hid under the bed inside. They supported her out the door and ordered her to make obeisance. Emperor Wu alighted from his carriage and wept, saying: \"Ah! Elder sister, why did you hide so deeply!\" He ordered the secondary carriage to carry her, turned the carriage around and galloped back, going straight into Changlegong Palace. He issued orders to the gate officials to record her name and permit passage to audience with the empress dowager. The empress dowager said: \"The emperor is weary, where has he come from?\" The emperor said: \"Today I went to Changling and obtained my subject-sister, and have come together with her.\" He turned and said: \"Audience with the empress dowager!\" The empress dowager said: \"Are you so-and-so's daughter?\" She said: \"Yes.\" The empress dowager wept below, and the girl also prostrated herself and wept. Emperor Wu presented wine and toasted her longevity, bestowed ten million cash, three hundred slaves and maids, one hundred qing of public fields, and an armored residence, to grant to his sister. The empress dowager declined, saying: \"This costs the emperor too much.\" Therefore, he summoned Princess Pingyang, Princess Nangong, and Princess Linlü, the three of them, to come and audience with their sister, and thus styled her Lord Xiucheng. She had one son and one daughter. The son was styled Xiuchengzi Zhong, the daughter became queen consort to various feudal kings. These two children were not of the Liu clan, therefore the empress dowager pitied them. Xiuchengzi Zhong was arrogant and unrestrained, bullying officials and people, all suffered bitterly from him.",
