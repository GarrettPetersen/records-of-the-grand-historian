Ling Lun blew the yang sounds to make six pitch pipes, blew the yin sounds to make six pitch pipes, altogether twelve pitch pipes. He took the tube that sounded gong as the Yellow Bell, and used it to determine the twelve pitch pipes. The Yellow Bell is the root of the twelve pitch pipes, the foundation of the six laws. Among the twelve earthly branches it corresponds to hai. Hai means 'to include'. It says yang qi is hidden below, therefore it includes.",
