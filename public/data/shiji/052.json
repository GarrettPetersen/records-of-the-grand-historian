Your Lordship surrounding the king is certainly good. I request to lead troops for your Lordship to guard the king.' Zhao Ping believed him and had Wei Bo lead troops to surround the king's palace. Once Wei Bo had troops, he had them surround the chancellor's residence. Zhao Ping said: 'Alas! The Daoist saying 'when you should cut off, don't cut off, and you will suffer disorder instead'—this is indeed it.' He then committed suicide. Thus the King of Qi appointed Si Jun as chancellor, Wei Bo as general, Zhu Wu as interior minister, and mobilized all troops in the state. He sent Zhu Wu east to deceive the King of Langye, saying: 'The Lü clan is creating disorder, the King of Qi has raised troops and wishes to go west to execute them. The King of Qi considers himself still a child, young and inexperienced in military affairs, and wishes to entrust the entire state to your majesty. Your majesty was personally Gaozu's general and is experienced in warfare. The King of Qi dares not leave his troops, so he sends me to request your majesty to graciously come to Linzi to see the King of Qi and discuss affairs, and moreover lead the Qi troops west to pacify the disorder in Guanzhong.' The King of Langye believed it and considered it right, so he galloped to see the King of Qi.

Now the King of Qi in terms of kinship is increasingly distant.' He then casually spoke: 'During Lü Empress Dowager time Qi desired to rebel, during Wu and Chu time King Xiao nearly created disorder. Now I hear the King of Qi commits incest with his sister.' Thus the Son of Heaven appointed Zhu Fu Yan as Qi chancellor, and to investigate the matter. Zhu Fu Yan having arrived in Qi, urgently interrogated the eunuchs in the king's rear palace who had enabled the king's liaisons with his sister Princess Ji, commanding their confessions and testimony to all implicate the king. The king was young, feared great crime and being arrested and executed by officials, so drank poison to commit suicide. He had no descendants.",
