Cheng Ying said: 'Shuo's wife has a posthumous pregnancy, if luckily a boy, I will support him;' if a girl, I will slowly die.' After not long, Shuo's wife gave birth, bore a boy. Tu An Jia heard of it, searched in the palace. The lady placed the child and cursed the crack diviner saying: 'If the Zhao lineage is extinguished, cry;' if not extinguished, make no sound.' When searched, the child ultimately made no sound. Already escaped, Cheng Ying told Gong Sun Chu Jiu: 'Now one search did not find, later must search again, what to do?' Gong Sun Chu Jiu said: 'Establishing the orphan or dying, which is harder?' Cheng Ying said: 'Dying is easy, establishing the orphan is hard.' Gong Sun Chu Jiu said: 'The Zhao clan's late lords treated you generously, you be strong for the hard one, I will do the easy one, please let me die first.' So the two plotted to take another's infant child and carry it, clothed in embroidered robe, hid in the mountains. Cheng Ying went out, falsely told the generals: 'Ying is unworthy, cannot establish the Zhao orphan.' Who can give me a thousand jin, I will tell the Zhao orphan's location.' The generals all rejoiced, promised him, dispatched troops following Cheng Ying to attack Gong Sun Chu Jiu. Chu Jiu falsely said: 'Petty man Cheng Ying!' Formerly in the Lower Palace difficulty could not die, conspired with me to hide the Zhao orphan child, now again sells me.' Even if cannot establish, how can bear to sell!' Holding the child called: 'Heaven, heaven!' What crime has the Zhao orphan?' Please let him live, killing Chu Jiu alone is acceptable.' The generals did not permit, so killed Chu Jiu and the orphan child. The generals thought the Zhao orphan was truly dead, all rejoiced.

The generals entered to inquire about the illness, Duke Jing used Han Jue's forces to threaten the generals and show them the Zhao orphan. The Zhao orphan was named Wu. The generals had no choice but said: 'The former Lower Palace difficulty, Tu An Jia did it, forged the lord's command, and commanded all ministers.' If not so, who would dare create disorder!' Without my lord's illness, the ministers would certainly have requested to establish the Zhao successor.' Now my lord has command, it is the ministers' wish.' Then summoned Zhao Wu and Cheng Ying to bow to all the generals, then turned and with Cheng Ying and Zhao Wu attacked Tu An Jia, exterminated his clan. Restored Zhao Wu's fields and cities as before.",

Jian Zi left, Dong An Yu told his son Zhuang: 'You know this first.' Zhao Jian Zi dreamed of burying himself and seeing the Emperor, and on the ji si day buried himself. When Zhao Wu Ling Wang was born, he seized from his elder brother Zhang and established himself, this was Zhao Wu Ling Wang. From Zhao Su downward, they did not lose their lineage, down to the Wang clan. Therefore ritual does not necessarily follow one path, and what benefits the state does not necessarily follow antiquity. When sages arise they do not imitate each other and become kings, when Xia and Yin declined they did not change rituals and perish. Thus returning to antiquity cannot be criticized, and following ritual is not sufficiently praiseworthy. Moreover, wearing strange clothing leads to licentious ambitions, but this means Zou and Lu have no extraordinary conduct; when customs are deviant the people are easily led astray, but this means Wu and Yue have no outstanding scholars. Moreover, sages call benefiting the body 'clothing', call facilitating affairs 'ritual'. The regulations of advancing and retreating, the systems of clothing—these are for regulating ordinary people, not for discussing worthy people. Therefore ordinary people follow customs and flow with them, worthy people follow change together with it. Therefore the proverb says 'Using books to control chariots does not exhaust the horse's feelings, using ancient systems to control the present does not reach the changes of affairs.' Following law's merit is not sufficient to stand above the age; studying antiquity is not sufficient to control the present. You do not understand this.'

Qin and Zhao are allied states, with strength they conscripted troops from Han, does Qin truly love Zhao? Or does it actually hate Qi? The extreme of things, worthy lords examine it. Qin does not love Zhao and hate Qi, it wants to destroy Han and swallow the two Zhou, therefore uses Qi to feed the world. Fearing that affairs would not succeed, therefore sent troops to coerce Wei and Zhao. Fearing that the world would fear itself, therefore sent hostages to establish trust. Fearing that the world would quickly rebel, therefore conscripted troops from Han to intimidate them. In name giving virtue to states, in reality attacking empty Han, your servant considers Qin's plan must come from this. Things indeed have situations that differ yet troubles are the same: Chu long attacked and Zhongshan perished, now Qi long attacked and Han must perish. Breaking Qi, your majesty and the six states divide its profits. Destroying Han, Qin monopolizes it alone.
