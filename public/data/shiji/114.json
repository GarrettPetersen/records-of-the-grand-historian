After Qin unified the empire, it deposed them as rulers and made their lands Minzhong commandery. When the feudal lords rebelled against Qin, Wu Zhu and Yao led the Yue people to submit to Poyang magistrate Wu Rui—the one called Lord Po—and followed the feudal lords in overthrowing Qin. At this time, Xiang Ji controlled the mandate and did not enfeoff them as kings, so they did not attach themselves to Chu. When Han attacked Xiang Ji, Wu Zhu and Yao led the Yue people to aid Han. In the fifth year of Han, Wu Zhu was again established as Min Yue king, ruling the old Minzhong lands with his capital at Dongye. In the third year of Emperor Hui, recognizing the Yue merits from the time of Gao Di, it was said that Lord Yao of Min had many merits and his people were conveniently attached, so Yao was established as Dong Hai king with his capital at Dong'ou, which the common people called the Dong'ou king.",

In the third year of Jian Yuan, Min Yue sent troops to besiege Dong'ou. Dong'ou ran out of food, was in dire straits, and was about to surrender, so sent envoys to urgently report to the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven consulted Grand Commandant Tian Fen, who replied: 'The Yue people attacking each other is certainly their custom, and they have repeatedly been fickle, so it is not worth troubling China to go save them. Since Qin times they have been abandoned and not governed.' Then Zhong Dafu Zhuang Zhu interrogated Fen: 'The special worry is not that strength cannot save them, nor that virtue cannot cover them; If we truly can, why abandon them? Moreover, Qin took Xianyang and abandoned it—how much more so with Yue! Now a small kingdom comes to urgently report distress to the Son of Heaven, and if the Son of Heaven does not revive it, where should they go to make their complaints? And how then to govern the ten thousand kingdoms?' The emperor said: 'The Grand Commandant is not sufficient to plan with. I have just ascended the throne and do not wish to issue tiger tallies to mobilize troops from the commanderies and kingdoms.' Then dispatched Zhuang Zhu with credentials to mobilize troops from Kuaiji. The Kuaiji Grand Administrator wanted to resist and not send troops, but Zhu executed one Colonel and made clear his intentions, so troops were sent sailing across the sea to save Dong'ou. Before they arrived, Min Yue led troops away. Dong'ou requested to move the entire kingdom to China, so they all moved their people and settled between the Jiang and Huai rivers.",

Nan Yue observed the Son of Heaven's covenant and did not dare arbitrarily send troops to attack, but reported it instead. The emperor dispatched Grand Messenger Wang Hui from Yuzhang and Grand Provisioner Han An Guo from Kuaiji, both as generals. Before the troops crossed the ranges, Min Yue king Ying sent troops to block the defiles. His younger brother Yu Shan then plotted with the chancellor and clansmen, saying: 'The king arbitrarily sent troops to attack Nan Yue without permission, so the Son of Heaven's troops have come to execute him. Now the Han troops are numerous and strong; if we luckily defeat them now, more will come later, and it will end with the kingdom's destruction.' Now let us kill the king to apologize to the Son of Heaven.' If the Son of Heaven listens, he will dismiss the troops and certainly preserve the kingdom intact; If he does not listen, then we will fight with all our strength; If we do not win, we will flee into the sea.' All said: 'Good.' Immediately assassinated the king and sent envoys to present his head to the Grand Messenger. The Grand Messenger said: 'What we came for was to execute the king. Now that the king's head has arrived and they have apologized for their crimes, we can avoid battle and reap the harvest—there is no greater advantage.' Then, acting on his own discretion, he halted the troops and informed the Grand Provisioner's army, while sending envoys to present the king's head and gallop to report to the Son of Heaven. An edict dismissed the two generals' troops, saying: 'Ying and the others were the chief culprits, only Wu Zhu's grandson Lord Rou Chou did not participate in the plotting.' Then sent a Palace Attendant in charge of cavalry to establish Chou as Yue Rou king, to maintain the ancestral sacrifices of Min Yue.",

When General Heng Hai arrived first, Yue Yan marquis Wu Yang rebelled with seven hundred men from his fief and attacked the Yue army at Hanyang. Following Jian Cheng marquis Ao and his commanders, together with King Rou's Ju Gu, they plotted: 'Yu Shan is the chief culprit, coercing and guarding us dependents. Now Han troops have arrived, numerous and strong; let us plan to kill Yu Shan, surrender ourselves to the various generals, and perhaps luckily escape.' Then they all killed Yu Shan and surrendered their forces to General Heng Hai, so King Rou's Ju Gu was enfeoffed as Dong Cheng marquis with ten thousand households; Jian Cheng marquis Ao was enfeoffed as Kai Ling marquis; Yue Yan marquis Wu Yang was enfeoffed as Bei Shi marquis; General Heng Hai Shuo was enfeoffed as An Dao marquis; Heng Hai Colonel Fu was enfeoffed as Liao Yi marquis. Fu was a son of King Gong of Cheng Yang, formerly Marquis of Hai Chang, but lost his marquisate for violating the law. He had previously followed the army without merit, but was made a marquis because of his imperial clan status. The various generals had no successful merits and none were enfeoffed. Dong Yue general Duo Jun, when Han troops arrived, abandoned his army and surrendered, and was enfeoffed as Wu Xi marquis.",
