Their original surname was Jiang, but they took the name of their fief, and thus he was called Lü Shang.",

Thus King Wen went hunting, and indeed met Tai Gong on the northern bank of the Wei River.

He wandered about trying to persuade the feudal lords, but found no one who would listen, and finally went west to return to King Wen of Zhou. Some say Lü Shang was a scholar in retirement, living in seclusion by the seashore. When King Wen of Zhou was imprisoned at Youli, San Yisheng and Hong Yao, who had long known Lü Shang, recruited him. Lü Shang also said: 'I have heard that King Wen is worthy and moreover treats the elderly well. Why not go there?' These three men sought beautiful women and rare treasures for King Wen, presented them to King Zhou, and thus redeemed King Wen. King Wen was thus able to leave prison and return to his state. Although the accounts of how Lü Shang served the Zhou differ, the essential point is that he became the master of Kings Wen and Wu.",

They went to garrison for one year, when melon time ended the duke did not send replacements for them. Some requested replacements, the duke did not permit it. Therefore these two men were angry, and plotted rebellion with Gong Sun Wu Zhi. Lian Cheng had a younger sister in the duke's palace, without favor, he had her spy on Duke Xiang, saying 'If the matter succeeds, I will make you Wu Zhi's wife.' Winter twelfth month, Duke Xiang toured Gu Fen, then hunted at Pei Qiu. He saw a pig, his followers said 'Peng Sheng.' The duke was angry, shot it, the pig stood up and cried. The duke was afraid, fell from the carriage injuring his foot, lost his shoe. Returning he whipped Fu, the keeper of the shoes, three hundred lashes. Fu left the palace. Wu Zhi, Lian Cheng, Guan Zhi Fu and others heard the duke was injured, then led their followers to attack the palace. They met Fu the shoe-keeper, Fu said: 'Do not enter yet and alarm the palace, an alarmed palace is not easy to enter.' Wu Zhi did not believe, Fu showed him the scars, then he believed. They waited outside the palace, ordered Fu to enter first. Fu entered first, then hid Duke Xiang behind the door. After a long time, Wu Zhi and others grew fearful, then entered the palace. Fu turned back and with the palace attendants and the duke's favored ministers attacked Wu Zhi and others, they did not prevail, all died. Wu Zhi entered the palace, searched for the duke but could not find him. Someone saw a person's foot behind the door, opened it to look, it was Duke Xiang, then assassinated him, and Wu Zhi established himself as lord of Qi.",

Qi sent Lu a letter saying: 'Prince Jiu is my brother, I cannot bear to execute him personally, please Lu kill him yourself. Zhao Hu and Guan Zhong are my enemies, please capture them so I may satisfy my hatred and mince them.' If not, I will besiege Lu.' The Lu people were troubled by this, then killed Prince Jiu at Sheng Du. Zhao Hu committed suicide, Guan Zhong requested imprisonment. When Duke Huan was established, he sent troops to attack Lu, in his heart desiring to kill Guan Zhong. Bao Shu Ya said: 'Your servant was fortunate to follow you, my lord was finally established. Your lordship's honor, your servant cannot increase it further. If my lord will govern Qi, then Gao Xi and Shu Ya are sufficient. But if my lord wishes to become hegemon and king, Guan Yi Wu is indispensable. Wherever Yi Wu resides, that state becomes important, he cannot be lost.' Thus Duke Huan followed this advice. Then he feigned summoning Guan Zhong to satisfy his hatred, but actually wished to employ him. Guan Zhong knew this, therefore requested to go. Bao Shu Ya welcomed and received Guan Zhong, when they reached Tang Fu he removed the shackles, purified himself and met Duke Huan.

Duke Huan showed off to Qu Wan with his multitude. Qu Wan said: 'If my lord comes by the proper way then it is acceptable; if not, then Chu takes Fangcheng as its wall, the Jiang and Han as its moat, how can my lord advance?'
