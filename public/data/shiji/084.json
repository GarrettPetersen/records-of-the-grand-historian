Thus he worried and brooded in sorrow and composed 'Li Sao'. 'Li Sao' means departing sorrow. Heaven is the beginning of man; Parents are man's foundation. When man is in distress he returns to fundamentals, thus when exhausted by toil and weariness, one inevitably cries to heaven; When pained by illness and suffering, one inevitably cries to parents. Qu Ping walked the straight path, exhausted loyalty and wisdom serving his lord. Slanderers came between them - he can be called destitute. Trusted yet suspected, loyal yet slandered - how could he not resent? Qu Ping's composition of 'Li Sao' arose from self-pity. 'Guo Feng' delights in beauty without licentiousness, 'Xiao Ya' resents and satirizes without disorder. As for 'Li Sao', it can be said to combine both. Above it praises Emperor Ku, below it describes Duke Huan of Qi, in the middle it narrates Tang and Wu, to criticize contemporary affairs. It illuminates the vast sublimity of morality, the systematic principles of order and chaos - nothing is not fully revealed. Its text is concise, its diction subtle, its ambition pure, its conduct honest. Its language is modest but its meaning extremely grand, citing near examples yet revealing far-reaching principles. Its ambition pure, thus it praises fragrant things. Its conduct honest, thus in death it would not let itself be distant. Washing in filthy mud, shedding like a cicada from impurity, to float and roam beyond the dust, not acquiring the world's defilement, pure white mud yet unstained.
