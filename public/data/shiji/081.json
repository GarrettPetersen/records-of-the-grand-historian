Qin King Zhao heard of this and sent someone with a letter to Zhao king, wishing to exchange fifteen cities for the jade disk. The Zhao king consulted with grand general Lian Po and the ministers: wishing to give it to Qin, fearing the cities could not be obtained, only being deceived; Wishing not to give it, then worried about Qin's troops coming. The plan undecided, they sought someone who could be sent to reply to Qin, but none found. Eunuch director Miao Xian said: 'My retainer Lin Xiangru can be sent.' The king asked: 'How do you know this?' He replied: 'I once committed a crime and secretly planned to flee to Yan. My retainer Xiangru stopped me, saying: \"How do you know the Yan king?\"' I told him: \"I once accompanied the great king to meet the Yan king at the border. The Yan king privately grasped my hand, saying 'I wish to befriend you'.\" With this I know him, thus wished to go.' Xiangru told me: 'Zhao is strong and Yan weak, and you are favored by the Zhao king, thus the Yan king wishes to befriend you. Now you flee Zhao for Yan, Yan fears Zhao, the situation certainly dares not keep you, but will bind you and return you to Zhao.' You should rather expose your flesh and submit to the axe to beg forgiveness, then fortunately escape.' I followed his plan, the great king also fortunately pardoned me. I secretly consider him a brave man with wisdom and strategy, suitable to send.' Thus the king summoned and saw Lin Xiangru, asking: 'The Qin king wishes to exchange fifteen cities for my jade disk. Should I give it or not?' Xiangru said: 'Qin is strong and Zhao weak, cannot but agree.' The king said: 'If they take my jade disk but not give me cities, what then?' Xiangru said: 'If Qin seeks the jade disk with cities but Zhao does not agree, the fault lies with Zhao.' If Zhao gives the jade disk but Qin does not give Zhao cities, the fault lies with Qin.' Between these two strategies, better to agree and let Qin bear the fault.' The king said: 'Who can be sent?' Xiangru said: 'If Your Majesty has no one, I wish to carry the jade disk and go as envoy.' If cities enter Zhao, the jade disk stays in Qin; If cities do not enter, I beg to return the intact jade disk to Zhao.' The Zhao king thus sent Xiangru carrying the jade disk west into Qin.",

Xiangru thus held the jade disk and stepped back, leaning against a pillar, his hair bristling and lifting his hat, telling the Qin king: 'Your Majesty wished to obtain the jade disk, sent people with letters to the Zhao king. The Zhao king summoned all ministers to discuss, all saying \"Qin is greedy, relying on its strength, seeking the jade disk with empty words, fearing the cities cannot be obtained.\"' The discussion did not wish to give Qin the jade disk. I considered that even commoners' friendships do not deceive each other, how much more great states! Moreover, for one jade disk's sake to offend strong Qin's favor is unacceptable. Thus the Zhao king purified himself for five days, sent me carrying the jade disk, bowing to send the letter in the court. Why? To honor the great state's prestige and show respect. Now I arrive, Your Majesty receives me in the side hall, the etiquette very arrogant. Obtaining the jade disk, passing it to beauties to play with and mock me. I see Your Majesty has no intention of paying Zhao king cities, thus I take back the jade disk. If Your Majesty wishes to force me, my head today will shatter with the jade disk against the pillar!' Xiangru held the jade disk glaring at the pillar, wishing to smash it. The Qin king feared he would break the jade disk, thus apologized profusely and earnestly requested, summoned officials to spread maps, pointing out from here onward fifteen commanderies to give Zhao. Xiangru judged the Qin king only used deceitful display to give Zhao cities, truly unobtainable, thus told the Qin king: 'The He family jade disk is a treasure transmitted by the world. The Zhao king feared, dared not not offer it.' When the Zhao king sent the jade disk, he purified himself five days. Now Your Majesty should also purify himself five days, set the nine-rank court in the hall, then I dare present the jade disk.' The Qin king considered it, ultimately could not forcibly seize, thus agreed to purify five days, housed Xiangru in Guangcheng hostel. Xiangru judged though the Qin king purified, he would certainly break the agreement not pay cities, thus had his followers dress in coarse cloth, hide the jade disk in their robes, escape by byways, return the jade disk to Zhao.",

Lian Po said: 'I serve as Zhao general, have great merit of attacking cities and field battles, yet Lin Xiangru only labors with words, yet position above me. Moreover Xiangru originally base person, I ashamed, cannot bear being below him.' He declared: 'If I see Xiangru, I will humiliate him.' Xiangru heard, refused to meet him. Xiangru at court always claimed illness, did not wish to contend with Lian Po for position. Afterward Xiangru went out, saw Lian Po from afar, Xiangru turned his chariot to hide. Thus his retainers together admonished: 'We left families and relatives to serve Your Lordship, only admiring Your Lordship's noble righteousness.' Now Your Lordship and Lian Po same rank, Lian openly speaks ill and Your Lordship fears and hides, fear extremely great. Even common people still ashamed of this, how much more ministers and generals! We unworthy, beg to resign.' Lin Xiangru firmly stopped them, saying: 'You consider Lian general compared to Qin king, who stronger?' They said: 'Not as good.' Xiangru said: 'With the Qin king's prestige, yet Xiangru berated him in court, humiliated his ministers. Though Xiangru cowardly, how fear Lian general alone?' I consider it: Strong Qin dares not use troops against Zhao, only because we two are there.' Now two tigers fight together, their situation cannot both survive.' I do this to put the state's urgency first and private enmity second.' Lian Po heard of this, exposed his flesh and carried thorns on his back, came through the retainers to Lin Xiangru's gate to apologize. Saying: 'This base person did not know the general's magnanimity reached this extent.' Ultimately they became harmonious, forming the friendship of cutting necks.",
