Xiang Liang sent messengers to Chen Ying, wishing to join forces. Chen Ying's mother said: 'I heard generals are like women's husbands, difficult to know. If we join Xiang Liang, we will become his subordinates. Better to go west alone.' Chen Ying sent messengers to Xiang Liang saying: 'My mother said generals are difficult to know. I wish to go west alone.' Xiang Liang was angry, attacked Chen Ying, defeated him. Chen Ying fled to Dongyang, Xiang Liang pursued and killed him. Xiang Liang took Dongyang, incorporated Chen Ying's troops, his forces grew to twenty thousand. Xiang Liang then led troops west, camped at Xiapi. At this time, Liu Ji was serving as magistrate of Pei, recruited troops, got several thousand men. Xiang Liang sent messengers to Liu Ji, wishing to join forces. Liu Ji's counselor Cao Can said: 'Xiang Liang is brave and has merit, but cannot be subordinate to.' Liu Ji was hesitant. Cao Can said: 'If we go, we will become his subordinates; if we don't go, he will attack us.' Liu Ji said: 'Then what to do?' With Qin's strength, attacking the newly established Zhao, they will certainly take Zhao. If Zhao falls and Qin grows stronger, what exhaustion to inherit! Moreover, the state's army was newly defeated, the king cannot sit at ease, sweeps the realm and entrusts it all to the general, the nation's safety and danger, depends on this one action. Now not caring for the soldiers but indulging his private desires, not a minister of the state.' Xiang Yu morning audience with Supreme General Song Yi, right in his tent beheaded Song Yi's head, issued orders in the army saying: 'Song Yi conspired with Qi to rebel against Chu, King Huai secretly ordered Yu to execute him.' At this time, the generals all were awed and submissive, none dared to disobey. All said: 'First to establish Chu was the general's family. Now the general executes the traitor.' They together established Yu as Acting Supreme General. Sent people to pursue Song Yi's son, caught him in Qi, killed him. Sent Huan Chu to report to King Huai. King Huai then made Xiang Yu Supreme General, all the Chu army was under Xiang Yu's command.",

Fan Zeng said: 'The prince is brave!' Then went out, called Xiang Zhuang to enter. Xiang Zhuang entered, Fan Zeng blocked the door and said: 'The prince wishes to give you a sword dance.' Xiang Zhuang danced with sword, Fan Zeng wished to strike Liu Bang. Xiang Zhuang hesitated. Liu Bang rose to relieve himself, wished to leave. Fan Kuai said: 'Now the matter is urgent, let me go in and protect.' Fan Kuai carried a sword and shield, entered the tent, sat with back to the wall, glared at Xiang Zhuang. Xiang Zhuang stopped dancing. Fan Kuai scolded Xiang Yu saying: 'My lord established you as king, you received the Chu king's order to attack Qin, now Qin is destroyed, you should divide the land to enfeoff the princes. Now you wish to kill the meritorious, this is the way to destroy Chu.' Xiang Yu could not reply, said: 'Sit and drink.' Fan Kuai sat and drank with Liu Bang. Liu Bang left to relieve himself, Fan Kuai followed out. Liu Bang said: 'The matter is urgent, I cannot return.' He called Zhang Liang to stay, gave him white jade ring as thanks to Xiang Yu. Liu Bang rode alone, fled through Xiaopi. Zhang Liang entered, Xiang Yu asked where Liu Bang was. Zhang Liang said: 'He left suddenly, saying he had urgent business.'

The princes' armies cut paths, Xiang Yu feared they would take advantage, secretly ordered the strong Chu army to follow behind and kill them. When the princes' armies entered the passes, Xiang Yu sealed the passes, did not let them enter. He stationed troops to guard the passes, then led the Chu army west alone. When Xiang Yu reached Hangu Pass, the Qin forces were still many. Xiang Yu attacked, defeated Qin, entered Hangu Pass. King Yi though without merit, should still divide land and make him king.' The generals all said: 'Good.' Then divided the world, established the generals as marquises and kings. Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng suspected Liu Bang of having ambitions for the world, but having already made peace, and fearing to break the agreement and cause the lords to rebel, secretly plotted saying: 'The roads to Ba and Shu are dangerous, Qin's exiled people all live in Shu.' Then said: 'Ba and Shu are also Guanzhong territory.' Therefore established Liu Bang as Han King, ruling Ba, Shu, Hanzhong, with capital at Nanzheng. And divided Guanzhong into three, made Qin surrendering generals kings to block Han King. Xiang Yu then established Zhang Han as Yong King, ruling west of Xianyang, with capital at Feiqiu. Chief Scribe Xin was formerly Queyang prison clerk, once had kindness to Xiang Liang; Colonel Dong Yi originally advised Zhang Han to surrender to Chu. Therefore established Sima Xin as Sai King, ruling east of Xianyang to the Yellow River, with capital at Queyang; Established Dong Yi as Di King, ruling Shangjun, with capital at Gao. When the division was completed, Xiang Yu wished to march east. He camped at Gaixia, and the Han King Liu Bang attacked him. Xiang Yu said: 'Our army has fought for three years, killed generals, crossed passes, taken cities, but the enemy is many and we are few.' He sent Long Ju to ask Han Xin to attack Qi. Han Xin said: 'The overlord is in danger, I cannot abandon him.' Xiang Yu then sent Wu She to persuade Han Xin. Wu She said: 'You and the overlord both Chu people, but you became king of Qi. Now the overlord is in danger, but you do not help, this is disloyal.' Han Xin said: 'The overlord once made me king, I am grateful. But I have heard that if the mother is kind, the son is filial; if the lord is enlightened, the minister is loyal. Now the overlord treats me with suspicion and sends someone else, this shows he does not trust me.' Wu She returned and told Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu sent Ji Xin to attack Qi. Ji Xin attacked Qi, Han Xin defended Qi. Han Xin said: 'Ji Xin is brave but not strategic, I can defeat him.' Han Xin lured Ji Xin into a trap, captured him. Han Xin then attacked Chu, defeated Xiang Yu at Gaixia. Xiang Yu retreated to Dongcheng.",
