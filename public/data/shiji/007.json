          "text": "Zhao Ping of Guangling was at that time pacifying Guangling for King Chen but had not yet been able to take it. Hearing that King Chen had been defeated and fled, and that Qin troops were about to arrive, he crossed the Yangtze, falsely invoked King Chen's command, and appointed Liang as Supreme Pillar of State of the King of Chu. He said: \"The east of the Yangtze is already settled; urgently lead troops west to attack Qin.\" Xiang Liang then crossed the Yangtze westward with eight thousand men. Hearing that Chen Ying had already taken Dongyang, he sent an envoy wishing to join forces with him and go west together. Chen Ying was a former clerk of the Dongyang magistrate; residing in the county, he had always been trustworthy and careful, known as an elder. The young men of Dongyang killed their magistrate and assembled several thousand men; wishing to establish a leader but finding none suitable, they invited Chen Ying. Ying declined saying he was unable, but they forcibly made Ying their leader; those who followed him from the county numbered twenty thousand. The young men wished to make Ying king immediately, establishing an exceptional army distinguished by its black-headed [common] origins. Chen Ying's mother said to Ying: \"Since I became your family's daughter-in-law, I have never heard that your ancestors had anyone of high rank. Now to suddenly gain great fame is inauspicious. It would be better to attach yourself to someone; if the affair succeeds you can still be enfeoffed as a marquis; if it fails you can easily escape, and you will not be one singled out by name.\" Ying then did not dare become king. He told his military officers: \"The Xiang clan has been a family of generals for generations and is famous in Chu. Now if we wish to undertake a great affair, the general must not be the wrong person. If I rely on a renowned clan, the destruction of Qin is certain.\" Thereupon the multitude followed his words and submitted their troops to Xiang Liang. Xiang Liang crossed the Huai; Qing Bu and General Pu also brought their troops to join him. In all sixty to seventy thousand men, they encamped at Xiapei.",

          "text": "Earlier, the Qi envoy Lord Gaolin Xian whom Song Yi had met was with the Chu army and saw the King of Chu, saying: \"Song Yi predicted that Lord Wuxin's army would certainly be defeated, and after several days, the army was indeed defeated. That he could foresee signs of defeat before troops engaged in battle—this can be called understanding warfare.\" The king summoned Song Yi to consult on affairs and was greatly pleased with him; consequently he appointed him Supreme General, made Xiang Yu Duke of Lu as second general, and Fan Zeng final general, to rescue Zhao. All the separate generals were subordinate to Song Yi, who was titled Lord Superior to Ministers. They marched to Anyang and remained there for forty-six days without advancing. Xiang Yu said: \"I have heard that the Qin army has surrounded King Zhao at Julu; we should quickly lead troops across the river—Chu attacks from outside, Zhao responds from inside, and the Qin army will certainly be broken.\" Song Yi said: \"Not so. A gadfly that strikes an ox cannot break lice and nits. Now Qin attacks Zhao; if they win the battle their troops will be exhausted, and we take advantage of their exhaustion; if they do not win, then we lead troops beating drums westward and will certainly take Qin. Therefore it is better to let Qin and Zhao fight first. As for wearing armor and wielding sharp weapons, I am not your equal; as for sitting and devising strategies, you are not my equal.\" He then issued an order throughout the army: \"Those who are fierce as tigers, stubborn as sheep, greedy as wolves, and too headstrong to be commanded shall all be beheaded.\" He then sent his son Song Xiang as prime minister to Qi, personally escorting him to Wuyan, where they drank wine in grand celebration. The weather was cold with heavy rain; the officers and troops were freezing and starving. Xiang Yu said: \"We are to unite our strength to attack Qin, yet we remain long without moving. This year there is famine and the people are poor; the officers and troops eat taro and beans, the army has no stored grain, yet he drinks wine in grand celebration and does not lead troops across the river to obtain food from Zhao and join forces with Zhao to attack Qin, but instead says 'take advantage of their exhaustion.' Given Qin's strength attacking newly established Zhao, the situation will certainly result in Zhao being taken. When Zhao is taken and Qin grows stronger, what exhaustion is there to take advantage of! Moreover, our state's army is newly broken, the king sits uneasy in his seat, having swept the territory to entrust everything to the general; the state's safety or danger rests on this single action. Now he does not care for the officers and troops but pursues his private interests—he is not a minister of the altars of soil and grain.\" Xiang Yu at morning audience with Supreme General Song Yi entered his tent and beheaded Song Yi's head, then issued orders throughout the army saying: \"Song Yi conspired with Qi to rebel against Chu; the King of Chu secretly ordered Yu to execute him.\" At that time, all the generals were terrified into submission; none dared resist. They all said: \"It was the general's family who first established Chu. Now the general has executed disorder.\" Thereupon they together installed Yu as Acting Supreme General. He sent men to pursue Song Yi's son, caught up with him in Qi, and killed him. He sent Huan Chu to report the order to King Huai. King Huai consequently made Xiang Yu Supreme General; Lord Dangyang and General Pu were both subordinated to Xiang Yu.",

If not, you and your kind will all become his captives.\" Zhuang then entered to offer a toast; when the toast was finished, he said: \"The king and Pei Gong are drinking; in the army there is no way to make merry—I request to perform a sword dance.\" King Xiang said: \"Very well.\" Xiang Zhuang drew his sword and rose to dance; Xiang Bo also drew his sword and rose to dance, constantly using his body to shield Pei Gong with his wings, so Zhuang could not strike. Thereupon Zhang Liang went to the army gate and saw Fan Kuai. Fan Kuai said: \"How go today's affairs?\" Liang said: \"Very urgent.

Though the Righteous Emperor had no achievements, he should still be given his share of territory to rule.\" All the generals said: \"Excellent.\" He then divided all under Heaven and installed the generals as marquis-kings.

The envoy returned and reported to King Xiang; King Xiang then suspected Fan Zeng of having secret dealings with Han and gradually took away his authority. Fan Zeng was greatly enraged and said: \"The affairs of all under Heaven are largely settled; may the king manage them yourself. I request to be granted my aged bones to return to the ranks.\"",

King Xiang's army was encamped at Gaixia; troops were few and food exhausted; the Han army and feudal lords' troops surrounded them in several layers. At night they heard the Han army singing Chu songs on all four sides; King Xiang was then greatly shocked and said: \"Has Han already obtained all of Chu? Why are there so many Chu people!\" King Xiang then rose at night and drank in his tent. There was a beautiful woman named Yu who was constantly favored and followed him; a fine horse named Zhui that he constantly rode. Thereupon King Xiang was grieved and sang with passion, composing a poem himself, saying: \"My strength pulled up mountains, my spirit covered the world; yet times are unfavorable and Zhui will not advance. When Zhui will not advance, what can be done? Yu, oh Yu, what shall I do with you!\" He sang several stanzas; the beautiful woman harmonized with him. King Xiang wept, tears streaming down; those around him all wept, none able to look up. Thereupon King Xiang mounted his horse and rode; over eight hundred brave warriors under his command rode following him, burst straight through the encirclement by night heading south, and galloped away. At dawn, the Han army realized this and ordered cavalry general Guan Ying to pursue him with five thousand cavalry. King Xiang crossed the Huai; only about a hundred riders were able to follow.

After King Xiang died, all the lands of Chu surrendered to Han; only Lu would not submit. Han then led all under Heaven's troops wishing to massacre it, but because they maintained ritual propriety and died loyal to their lord, they took King Xiang's head to show Lu; the fathers and elder brothers of Lu then surrendered. At first, when King Huai of Chu first enfeoffed Xiang Ji as Duke of Lu, and when he died, Lu was the last to submit; therefore they buried King Xiang at Gucheng with the rites of Duke of Lu. The King of Han announced mourning for him, wept, and departed. All the Xiang clan's branch relatives—the King of Han did not execute any. He then enfeoffed Xiang Bo as Marquis of Sheyang. Marquis of Tao, Marquis of Pinggao, and Marquis of Xuanwu were all of the Xiang clan; they were bestowed the surname Liu. The Grand Historian says: I heard from Zhou Sheng who said \"Shun's eyes had double pupils\"; I also heard that Xiang Yu also had double pupils. Could Yu be his descendant? How sudden was his rise! When Qin lost its governance, Chen She first raised difficulties; heroes arose like a swarm of bees and competed together—their numbers cannot be counted. Yet Yu without even a foot or inch of territory, riding and rising from among the fields, in three years then led the five feudal lords to destroy Qin, divided and carved up all under Heaven, and enfeoffed kings and marquises; governance issued from Yu; he was titled \"Hegemon-King\"—though his position did not last, from ancient times until now there has never been such a case. When Yu turned his back on Guanzhong and longed for Chu, banished the Righteous Emperor and made himself king, resentment grew and the kings and marquises rebelled against him—this was difficult indeed. Boasting of his achievements and victories, flourishing his personal cleverness without following the ancients, thinking the hegemon-king's enterprise could be managed by conquering all under Heaven through force alone—in five years he finally lost his state; his body died at Dongcheng, yet still he did not awaken or blame himself—this was an error. In the end, Gentleman Rider Yang Xi, Cavalry Major Lü Matong, Gentleman Lü Sheng, and Yang Wu each obtained one part of his body. The five men together assembled his body; all parts matched. Therefore they divided his territory into five: enfeoffed Lü Matong as Marquis of Zhongshui, enfeoffed Wang Yi as Marquis of Duyan, enfeoffed Yang Xi as Marquis of Chiquan, enfeoffed Yang Wu as Marquis of Wufang, enfeoffed Lü Sheng as Marquis of Nieyang.",
