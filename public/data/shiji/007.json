King Xiang wished to make himself king and first made the generals and ministers kings. He said: \"When all under Heaven first raised difficulties, we provisionally installed descendants of feudal lords to attack Qin. Yet I personally wore armor and wielded sharp weapons to initiate affairs, exposed in the wilderness for three years; those who destroyed Qin and settled all under Heaven were all you generals, ministers, and lords together with Ji's strength. Though the Righteous Emperor had no achievements, he should still be given his share of territory to rule.\" All the generals said: \"Excellent.\" He then divided all under Heaven and installed the generals as marquis-kings. King Xiang and Fan Zeng suspected Pei Gong of having designs on all under Heaven; affairs had already been reconciled, yet they were reluctant to break the agreement and feared the feudal lords would rebel; so they secretly plotted, saying: \"The roads of Ba and Shu are treacherous; the Qin people who were exiled all reside in Shu.\" They then said: \"Ba and Shu are also Guanzhong territory.\" Therefore they installed Pei Gong as King of Han, to rule Ba, Shu, and Hanzhong, with his capital at Nanzheng. They divided Guanzhong into three parts, making kings of the surrendered Qin generals to block the King of Han. King Xiang then installed Zhang Han as King of Yong, ruling west of Xianyang, with his capital at Feiqiu. Chief Clerk Xin had formerly been a prison clerk at Liyang and once had shown kindness to Xiang Liang; Commandant Dong Yi had originally urged Zhang Han to surrender to Chu. Therefore he installed Sima Xin as King of Sai, ruling from east of Xianyang to the Yellow River, with his capital at Liyang; installed Dong Yi as King of Di, ruling Shangjun, with his capital at Gaonu. He moved King Bao of Wei to be King of Western Wei, ruling Hedong, with his capital at Pingyang. Shen Yang of Xiaqiu was a favorite minister of Zhang Er; he had first taken Henan Commandery and welcomed Chu at the Yellow River, so they installed Shen Yang as King of Henan, with his capital at Luoyang. King Cheng of Han retained his former capital, with his capital at Yangzhai. Zhao general Sima Ang had pacified Henei and repeatedly achieved merit, so they installed Ang as King of Yin, ruling Henei, with his capital at Chaoge. They moved King Xie of Zhao to be King of Dai. Zhao's Prime Minister Zhang Er had always been worthy and also followed them into the passes, so they installed Er as King of Changshan, ruling Zhao territory, with his capital at Xiangguo. Lord Dangyang Qing Bu as Chu general had always been foremost, so they installed Bu as King of Jiujiang, with his capital at Liu. Lord Po Wu Rui led the Hundred Yue to assist the feudal lords and also followed them into the passes, so they installed Rui as King of Hengshan, with his capital at Zhu. The Righteous Emperor's Supreme Pillar of State Gong Ao led troops to attack Nanjun with many achievements, so they installed Ao as King of Linjiang, with his capital at Jiangling. They moved King Han Guang of Yan to be King of Liaodong. Yan general Zang Tu followed Chu to rescue Zhao and consequently followed them into the passes, so they installed Tu as King of Yan, with his capital at Ji. They moved King Tian Shi of Qi to be King of Jiaodong. Qi general Tian Du followed together to rescue Zhao and consequently followed them into the passes, so they installed Du as King of Qi, with his capital at Linzi. Tian An, grandson of King Jian of Qi whom Qin had destroyed—when Xiang Yu was crossing the Yellow River to rescue Zhao, Tian An took several cities in Jibei and led his troops to surrender to Xiang Yu, so they installed An as King of Jibei, with his capital at Boyang. Thus the feudal lords were all enfeoffed; they all went to their states. King Huai of Chu, the Righteous Emperor, was without territory. In the tenth month, King Xiang of Chu left Xiang Yu to go to Pengcheng, killed Tian An of Jibei, made his state part of Chu.

King Xiang heard this and made camp at Lu, attacking eastward. Marquis of Jiangxia and the King of Han's troops saw King Xiang coming and fled. King Xiang then gathered his troops together and went west from Xiao, striking the Han army at dawn and going east, reaching Pengcheng at midday, greatly defeating the Han army. The Han army all fled, following each other into the Gu and Si rivers; over a hundred thousand Han troops were killed. The Han troops all fled south to the mountains; Chu pursued and struck them to east of Lingbi at the Sui River. The Han army retreated and was pushed back by Chu; many were killed; over a hundred thousand Han troops all entered the Sui River, and the Sui River stopped flowing because of them. They surrounded the King of Han three times round. Thereupon a great wind arose from the northwest, breaking trees and overturning houses, raising sand and stones, darkness descending at midday, striking head-on against the Chu army. The Chu army was thrown into great disorder and scattered, and the King of Han was then able to escape with several tens of riders; he wished to pass through Pei to collect his family and go west; but Chu also sent men to pursue them to Pei and take the King of Han's family—the family had all disappeared and did not meet the King of Han. On the road the King of Han happened to find Xiao Hui and Lu Yuan and then loaded them on his chariot. Chu cavalry pursued the King of Han; the King of Han in his urgency pushed Xiao Hui and Lu Yuan off the chariot; Duke Teng constantly got down to pick them up and load them back. It was like this three times. He said: \"Though urgent, we cannot drive fast—how can you abandon them?\" Thereupon they finally escaped. Seeking the Grand Duke and Lü Hou, they did not meet.",
