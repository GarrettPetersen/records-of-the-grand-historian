In the tenth month, Emperor Xiaohui held a banquet and drank with the King of Qi before the Empress Dowager; Emperor Xiaohui considered the King of Qi his elder brother, placed him in the seat of honor, following the rites of family members. The Empress Dowager was angry and ordered two cups of poison poured and placed before them, ordering the King of Qi to rise and offer a toast. The King of Qi rose; Emperor Xiaohui also rose, took the cup wishing to toast together. The Empress Dowager was then afraid and personally rose to overturn Emperor Xiaohui's cup. The King of Qi found this strange and consequently did not dare drink, feigned drunkenness, and departed. Inquiring, he learned it was poison; the King of Qi was afraid, considering he could not escape Chang'an alive, and worried. Qi's Internal Administrator Shi persuaded the king, saying: \"The Empress Dowager only has Emperor Xiaohui and Princess Lu Yuan. Now the king has over seventy cities, while the princess eats from only several cities. If the king truly offers one commandery to the Empress Dowager as a bathing estate for the princess, the Empress Dowager will certainly be pleased and the king will certainly have no worries.\" Thereupon the King of Qi offered up the commandery of Chengyang and honored the princess as Queen Dowager. Empress Lü was pleased and permitted it. She then held a banquet at the Qi residence, drank in enjoyment, dismissed it, and returned the King of Qi. In the third year, they were constructing the walls of Chang'an; in the fourth year half was completed; in the fifth and sixth years the walls were completed. The feudal lords came to assemble.

The queen's attending officials were all various Lü who wielded power arbitrarily, secretly spied on the King of Zhao, and the King of Zhao could not act as he wished. The king had a consort he loved; the queen sent someone to poison and kill her. The king then composed four chapters of songs and poems and had musicians sing them. The king grieved; in the sixth month he committed suicide. The Empress Dowager heard of this and considered that the king had abandoned ancestral temple rites because of a woman; she abolished his succession.",

Yet the various Lü have again arbitrarily elevated their own offices, gathered troops to amass authority, coerced ranked marquises and loyal ministers, and falsely issued edicts to command all under Heaven—this is why the ancestral temples are endangered. I lead troops to enter and execute those who should not be kings.\" Han hearing of this, Prime Minister Lü Chan and others then sent Marquis of Yingyin Guan Ying to lead troops to strike them. Guan Ying reached Yingyang and plotted, saying: \"The various Lü control troops within the passes, wishing to endanger the Liu clan and install themselves. Now if I break Qi and return to report, this will increase the Lü clan's resources.\" He then remained encamped at Yingyang, sent envoys to instruct the King of Qi and the feudal lords, made alliance with them, and waited for the Lü clan to make changes to together execute them. The King of Qi heard this and then returned his troops to the western border to await the agreement.",

Moreover, installing the eldest follows proper order; as he is known for benevolence and filial piety throughout all under Heaven, it is convenient.\" They then together secretly sent men to summon the King of Dai. The King of Dai sent men to decline and express thanks. After going back and forth twice, he then rode in six relay chariots. On the last day of the ninth month, the jiyou day, he reached Chang'an and lodged at the Dai residence. The great ministers all went to pay respects, presented the Son of Heaven's seal to the King of Dai, and together honored and installed him as Son of Heaven. The King of Dai declined several times; the assembled ministers firmly requested, and then he listened.",
