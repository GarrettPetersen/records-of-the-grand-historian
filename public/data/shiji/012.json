The emperor believed this, began to practice magic arts. Shaojun was made Palace Attendant, given gold to practice magic. Shaojun could make grain immortals appear, but could not make them stay. He said: 'The immortals do not come because the sacrifices are not grand enough.' He advised the emperor to make a great altar for the stove god, with a bronze pillar, nine tripods, all gilded, with purple silk curtains, jade vessels. He said: 'This way the immortals will come.' The emperor followed this, but the immortals still did not come. Shaojun became old, his magic ineffective, he died. The emperor sought similar people, but none could equal Shaojun.

But Queen Kang had lewd conduct, did not get along with the king, threatened each other with law. Queen Kang heard the General of Literary Accomplishment had died, wished to curry favor with the emperor, sent Luan Da through Marquis Yuecheng to seek audience and speak of magic. The Son of Heaven had already executed the General of Literary Accomplishment, afterward regretted his early death, grieved that his methods were not exhausted, when he saw Luan Da, greatly pleased. Da was tall and handsome, spoke of many strategies, dared to make grand claims, handled matters without doubt. The emperor gave him ten thousand catties of gold to make the Great Altar of Heaven. Da said: 'I have heard Huangdi did not die, became an immortal, rode a dragon ascended to heaven. I wish to refine gold to make vessels for eating and drinking, then immortals will come.' The emperor gave him more gold, but Da's magic failed, the gold could not be refined. The emperor executed Da. That year, the emperor toured Yongzhou. Second year, the emperor toured Yizhou.

Thirty-sixth year, the emperor toured Yanzhou. Thirty-seventh year, the emperor toured Jingzhou. When the tripod was completed, a dragon hung its whiskers down to welcome Huangdi. Huangdi rode up, his ministers and consorts followed up the dragon over seventy people, then departed. The remaining minor officials could not ascend, all held the dragon whiskers, the dragon whiskers pulled out, dropped Huangdi's bow. The common people gazed up at Huangdi having ascended to heaven, then embraced his bow and the dragon whiskers wailing. Therefore later generations named the place Dinghu, his bow Wuhao.' Therefore the Son of Heaven said: 'Alas! If I could truly be like Huangdi, I would view leaving wife and children as taking off shoes.' Then appointed Qing as Gentleman, sent east to await spirits at Tai Room.",
