Imperial edict to the Imperial Secretary: \"Formerly Yu dredged the nine rivers, opened the four waterways. Recently the Yellow River overflowed the lands, dike work never ceased. I have ruled the world for twenty-eight years, heaven seems to grant me a knight and great passage. Qian says 'flying dragon,' 'great goose on the shore,' perhaps almost there. Enfeoff the Earth Warrior General Luan Da with two thousand households as Marquis of Le Tong.\" Granted him a marquis' mansion, a thousand servants. Imperial carriages, horses, tents, curtains, utensils filled his house. Also married him to Princess Wei Chang, gave ten thousand jin of gold, renamed her fief Dang Li Princess. The emperor personally visited the Five Profits General's mansion. Messengers inquired and supplied what was needed, connected along the road. From the chief ministers down, all held banquets in his home, presented gifts. Thereupon the emperor also carved a jade seal saying \"Heaven Dao General,\" had messengers wear feathered robes, stand on white thatch at night, the Five Profits General also wore feathered robes, stood on white thatch to receive the seal, to show he was not a subject. Those wearing \"Heaven Dao\" would guide heavenly spirits for the emperor. Thereupon the Five Profits General often sacrificed at night in his home, wishing to summon spirits. Spirits had not come but hundreds of ghosts gathered, yet he could somewhat command them. Afterward he prepared equipment and went east to sea, seeking his teacher. Luan Da was seen for several months, wearing six seals, honored and shook the world, and in the Yan and Qi regions along the sea, all choked their breath and claimed they had secret techniques, could divine immortals.",

Should establish Taiyi and the emperor personally perform suburban sacrifices to him.\" The emperor was doubtful and undecided. The Qi man Gongsun Qing said: \"This year obtained the treasure ding, and this winter on xin si first day winter solstice, equals the Yellow Emperor's time.\" Qing had bamboo slips saying: \"The Yellow Emperor obtained the treasure ding at Wan Hou, consulted Guiyu Qu. Qu replied: 'The emperor obtained the treasure ding divine planchette, this year ji you first day winter solstice, obtained heaven's cycle, end and begin again.' Thereupon the Yellow Emperor welcomed the sun and pushed the planchette, after twenty years obtained first day winter solstice, altogether twenty pushes, three hundred eighty years. The Yellow Emperor became immortal and ascended to heaven.\" Qing wanted to present it through Shou Zhong. Shou Zhong saw the book was not orthodox, suspected it was false writing, declined saying: \"The treasure ding matter is already decided, what more is there to do!\" Qing then presented it through a favored person. The emperor was greatly pleased, summoned and questioned Qing. He replied: \"I received this book from Shen Gong, Shen Gong has died.\" The emperor said: \"Who is Shen Gong?\" Qing said: \"Shen Gong is a Qi man. Communicated with An Qisheng, received the Yellow Emperor's words, had no book, only this ding book. Said 'When Han rises again it will be like the Yellow Emperor's time. The Han sage will be among the great-grandsons of Gaozu. The treasure ding appears and communicates with spirits, performs feng and shan. Feng and shan seventy-two kings, only the Yellow Emperor could ascend Mount Tai for feng.' Shen Gong said: 'The Han ruler should also ascend for feng, ascending feng then can become immortal and ascend to heaven. In the Yellow Emperor's time ten thousand feudal lords, and divine spirits' feng were seven thousand. World famous mountains eight, three in barbarian Yi, five in China. China's Huashan, Shoushan, Taishi, Taishan, Donglai, these five mountains the Yellow Emperor often toured, met with spirits. The Yellow Emperor fought while learning immortality. Worried the people did not follow his way, so he executed those who were not ghosts and spirits. After more than one hundred years then could communicate with spirits. The Yellow Emperor performed suburban sacrifices at Yong to the August Emperor, stayed three months. Guiyu Qu was called Great Hong, died and was buried at Yong, hence Hong Tomb. Afterward the Yellow Emperor received ten thousand spirits at Ming Court. Ming Court is Ganquan. The so-called Cold Gate is Gu Kou. The Yellow Emperor mined Shoushan copper, cast ding below Jing Mountain. When the ding was completed, a dragon hung its whiskers down to welcome the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor mounted it, group of ministers and rear palace followed on the dragon, seventy plus people, then ascended. The remaining small ministers could not ascend, all held the dragon whiskers, the dragon whiskers pulled out, dropped the Yellow Emperor's bow. The people looked up and saw the Yellow Emperor had ascended to heaven, embraced his bow and dragon whiskers wailing. Therefore later generations named the place Ding Lake, his bow Wu Hao.'\" Thereupon the emperor said: \"Alas! If I could truly be like the Yellow Emperor, I would view leaving wife and children like removing shoes.\" Then he appointed Qing as gentleman, sent east to await spirits at Taishi.",
