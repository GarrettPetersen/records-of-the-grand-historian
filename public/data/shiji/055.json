Arrived at Pengcheng, Han was defeated and returned. Arrived at Xiayi, the King of Han dismounted and sat on his saddle asking: 'I wish to abandon everything east of the passes—who can share merit with me?' Liang advanced and said: 'King Jiu Jiang Ying Bu is a fierce Chu general, has a grudge with Xiang Wang; Peng Yue is rebelling in Liang territory with King Qi Tian Rong: these two can be urgently employed. Among the King of Han's generals, only Han Xin can be entrusted with great matters, to hold one front. If you wish to abandon it, abandon it to these three men, then Chu can be broken.' The King of Han then sent Sui He to persuade King Jiu Jiang Bu, and sent people to contact Peng Yue. When King Wei Bao rebelled, he had Han Xin lead troops to attack him, thus raising Yan, Dai, Qi, and Zhao. Yet those who ultimately broke Chu were these three men's strength.",

The emperor said: 'Yong Chi and I are old acquaintances, several times he has distressed and humiliated me. I wished to kill him, but because his merit is great, I could not bear to.' The Marquis of Liu said: 'Now urgently first enfeoff Yong Chi to show the ministers, when the ministers see Yong Chi enfeoffed, then each person will be self-assured.' Thus the emperor set up wine, enfeoffed Yong Chi as Marquis of Shifang, and urgently urged the chancellor and superintendent to determine merits and carry out enfeoffments. The ministers finished the wine, all rejoiced saying: 'Yong Chi is still made marquis, we have no worries.'",

Empress Lü was fearful, did not know what to do. Someone told Empress Lü: 'The Marquis of Liu is skilled at planning strategies, the emperor trusts and employs him.' Empress Lü then sent Marquis Jiancheng Lü Ze to coerce the Marquis of Liu, saying: 'You have constantly been the emperor's planning minister, now the emperor wishes to change the crown prince—how can you lie high with pillow and sleep peacefully?' The Marquis of Liu said: 'At first the emperor was several times in dire straits, luckily used your servant's strategies. Now the realm is peaceful and stable, to change the crown prince out of favoritism—in family matters, even if we ministers number over a hundred, what benefit?' Lü Ze strongly urged: 'Plan for me.' The Marquis of Liu said: 'This cannot be disputed with words. There are four people in the realm whom the emperor cannot summon. These four people are old, all because they considered the emperor to slight and insult people, thus fled and hid in the mountains, righteously would not be Han ministers. Yet the emperor esteems these four people. Now if you can truly not spare gold, jade, walls, and silks, have the crown prince write a letter, humble words and comfortable carriage, moreover send eloquent officials to firmly request—they should come. When they come, treat them as guests, have them frequently accompany into court, let the emperor see them, then he will certainly regard them unusually and question them. When questioned, the emperor knowing these four are worthy, then it will be one help.' Thus Empress Lü commanded Lü Ze to send people carrying the crown prince's letter, humble words and generous gifts, to welcome these four people. The four people arrived, were guests at the Marquis of Jiancheng's residence.",
