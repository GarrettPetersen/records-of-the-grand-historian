          "literal": "I heard that the King of Liang entered west to court, greeted Empress Dowager Dou, banquet meeting, together with Emperor Jing served and sat before the empress dowager, private language pleased. The empress dowager told the emperor: 'I heard Yin way loves relatives, Zhou way honors superiors, their meanings are one. Peaceful carriage great procession, use Prince Xiao of Liang as the heir.' Emperor Jing knelt on the mat and raised his body saying: 'Yes.' Finished the wine and went out, the emperor summoned Yuan Ang and various ministers versed in classics saying: 'The empress dowager speaks like this, what does it mean?' All replied: 'The empress dowager intends to establish the King of Liang as imperial crown prince.' The emperor asked the circumstances, Yuan Ang and others said: 'Yin way loves relatives establishes younger brother. Zhou way honors superiors establishes son. Yin way substantial, substantial follows Heaven, loves those close to it, thus establishes younger brother. Zhou way cultured, cultured follows Earth, honor means respect, respects its origin, thus establishes eldest son. Zhou way, crown prince dies, establishes proper grandson. Yin way. Crown prince dies, establishes his younger brother.' The emperor said: 'To you gentlemen what is it?' All replied: 'Now the Han house follows Zhou, Zhou way cannot establish younger brother, should establish son. Therefore the Spring and Autumn Annals criticizes Duke Xuan of Song. Duke Xuan of Song died, did not establish son but gave to younger brother. Younger brother received the state died, again returned it to elder brother's son. Younger brother's son contended for it, considering I should succeed father's place, thus stabbed and killed elder brother's son. Therefore the state was chaotic, calamities did not cease. Therefore the Spring and Autumn Annals says 'The gentleman greatly occupies correctness, Song's calamity Duke Xuan made it.' Your servants request to see the empress dowager and inform her.' Yuan Ang and others entered to see the empress dowager: 'The empress dowager speaks wishing to establish the King of Liang, if the King of Liang should die, wishes to establish whom?' The empress dowager said: 'I will again establish the emperor's son.' Yuan Ang and others with Duke Xuan of Song not establishing properly, produced calamity, calamity and chaos after five generations not ceased, little intolerance harming great righteousness, reported to the empress dowager. The empress dowager then dispelled her idea, immediately had the King of Liang return to his fief. And the King of Liang heard that the righteousness came from Yuan Ang and the various ministers, resented, sent men to come kill Yuan Ang. Yuan Ang looked at him saying: 'The one called General Yuan is me, sir has not mistaken?' The assassin said: 'Correct!' Stabbed him, left his sword, the sword stuck in the body. Looked at his sword, newly forged. Asked Chang'an's sword sharpening workers, the worker said: 'A Liang attendant some son came to forge this sword.' With this knew and discovered it, sent envoys to capture and pursue them. Only the King of Liang desired to kill ministers more than ten, the civil officials investigated to the root, rebellion signs much appeared. The empress dowager did not eat, day and night wept without stopping. Emperor Jing greatly worried about it, asked the dukes and ministers, ministers considered sending classic versed officials to handle it, then could resolve. Thus sent Tian Shu, Lu Jizhu to handle it. These two both versed in classics, knew great ritual. Coming back, arrived at Bachang stable, took fire and completely burned Liang's rebellion documents, but came with empty hands to answer Emperor Jing. Emperor Jing said: 'What is it like?' Replied: 'Says the King of Liang did not know. Those who fabricated it were only his favored ministers Yang Sheng, Gongsun Gui and such did it. Respectfully they should be executed by law, the King of Liang is fine.' Emperor Jing pleased and happy, said: 'Quickly go announce to the empress dowager.' The empress dowager heard it, immediately rose and sat drinking, her energy calmed and recovered. Therefore it is said, if not versed in classics and knowing ancient and modern great ritual, cannot serve as three dukes and left and right close ministers. People of little knowledge are like peeking at heaven from a tube.",
