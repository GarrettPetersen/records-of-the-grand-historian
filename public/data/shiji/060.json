'Chancellor subject Qing Que, Censor-in-Chief subject Tang risking death speak: Subjects Qing Que and others with marquises, officials of two thousand shi, remonstrance officials, erudites subject Qing and others discuss: Risking death memorialize requesting to establish imperial sons as feudal kings. Imperial command: 'Kang Shu among ten relatives was honored alone because he praised virtue. The Duke of Zhou sacrificed to heaven at the suburban altar, thus Lu had white male and red strong sacrificial animals. The various dukes had no hair, distinguishing worthy and unworthy. 'High mountains are looked up to, brilliant conduct is followed', I greatly admire this. Therefore I suppress the immature, establishing them as marquises is acceptable.' Subjects Qing Que, Tang, Erudite subject Jiang Xing and others have heard that Kang Shu had ten relatives, King Wu succeeded to the throne, Duke of Zhou assisted King Cheng, eight of them were established as great states by the honor of their ancestors. Kang Shu was young in years, Duke of Zhou held the position of one of the three dukes, yet Bo Qin held the state at Lu, probably at the time of receiving the title, they had not yet reached adulthood. Later Kang Shu defended against the disaster of Lu Fu, Bo Qin extinguished the rebellion of the Huai Yi. In ancient times the Five Emperors had different systems, Zhou had five ranks, Spring and Autumn had three ranks, all ordered noble and base according to the times. Gao Emperor brought order to the chaotic world and returned to correctness, displayed supreme virtue, pacified within the seas, enfeoffed feudal lords, with two ranks of nobility. Imperial sons sometimes were established as feudal kings while still in swaddling clothes, supporting the Son of Heaven, as a model for ten thousand generations, cannot be changed. Your Majesty personally practices benevolence and righteousness, embodies and practices holy virtue, both inside and outside civil and martial. Displays the conduct of filial piety, broadens the path for the worthy and able. Within praising virtue, without attacking the strong and violent. Reached the Northern Sea, west to the Yuezhi, Xiongnu and Western Regions, the entire state supports the army. The costs of chariots and weapons, not levied from the people. Emptied the imperial storehouse to reward the chief warriors, opened forbidden granaries to relieve the poor, reduced garrison troops by half. The rulers of the hundred barbarian tribes, none do not face the wind, following the current and fulfilling intentions. Distant regions with different customs come to court through multiple translations, benevolence extends beyond the borders. Thus precious beasts arrive, auspicious grains flourish, heaven's response is very clear. Now feudal lords' branch sons are enfeoffed as feudal kings, yet to make imperial sons marquises, subjects Qing Que, Tang and others secretly and prostrate consider it, all think noble and base lose order, causing the world to lose hope, cannot. Subjects request to establish subjects Hong, Dan, Xu as feudal kings.' Fourth month, day gui-wei, memorialized at Weiyang Palace, kept in the palace not sent down.",
