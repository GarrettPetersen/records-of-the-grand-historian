King Hui said, 'The King of Chu is angry at your betrayal over Shangyu land—he will surely vent his anger on you.' Zhang Yi said, 'Qin is strong and Chu weak. I am close to Jin Shang, who serves Lady Zheng Xiu. Whatever she says is followed.' 'Moreover, I carry Your Majesty's credentials to Chu—how dare Chu execute me.' 'Even if they execute me and Qin gets Qianzhong, that would fulfill my greatest wish.' He went to Chu. The King of Chu imprisoned Zhang Yi and prepared to kill him. Jin Shang said to Zheng Xiu: 'Do you know how lowly you are to the king?' Zheng Xiu said, 'Why?' Jin Shang said: 'The King of Qin loves Zhang Yi greatly and doesn't want to send him. Now he offers six counties of Shangyong land to bribe Chu, and sends beautiful women as brides, with palace singers as attendants.' 'The King of Chu values the land and respects Qin—Qin women will certainly be honored while you, madam, will be cast aside.' 'Better to speak on his behalf to save him.' Zheng Xiu then day and night spoke to King Huai: 'Ministers each serve their own lord.' 'Now the land has not yet gone to Qin, yet Qin sends Zhang Yi, showing great respect for the king.' 'The king has shown no courtesy but wants to kill Zhang Yi—Qin will certainly be furious and attack Chu.' 'I beg you and my son to move to south of the Yangtze, lest we become Qin's fish and meat.'
